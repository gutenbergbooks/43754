<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p><i>Our book treats of a few of the Hill-cities of Umbria,
but it does not attempt exhaustive detail in regard to
Perugia, Assisi, or any other.</i></p>

<p><i>Several old contemporary writers have greatly helped
the book, notably the delightful chronicler Matarazzo,

Three Companions," and the very quaint "Fioretti
di San Francesco."</i></p>

<p><i>"The Life of San Bernardino of Siena," by Pierre

<p class="center p6 b20">PICTURES IN UMBRIA</p>

<h2 class="chap1">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="s08">AN ANCIENT HILL-CITY</span></h2>

<p>It has been said that the face which
exercises most permanent charm
is the face whose attractions defy
analysis; one in which beauty is
subtle, compounded of many and varied
qualities, so that, gazing at the harmonious
whole, it is impossible to
specialise its fascination.</p>

<p>Such a face will not, at first, reveal
its charm, for much of this does not
lie only in regularity of feature, or in
beauty of colouring, nor even in the
trick of a smile; the spell is so potent,
that when one at last tries to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
out its secret, the mind refuses to
dispel the sweet illusion by any such
work-a-day process, and agrees with
the hasheesh smoker, "to enjoy the
sweet dream while it lasts."</p>

<p>Places, as well as faces, exert this
undefined attraction, but in the former,
association often intrudes itself, a conscious
ingredient in the witchery they
possess for us.</p>

<p>I am just now thinking of a city
where much of the historic association
is repulsive, even horrible; looking at
the old grey walls of Perugia, the
mind strays backward, to times when
these ancient palaces with barred lower
windows were gloomy fortresses, in
which ghastly tragedies were acted over
and over again.</p>

<p>In some of the old houses dissolute
sons plotted how to murder their fathers
and brothers, how to commit every
sort of crime; blood has run like water
in the grass-grown streets and piazzas,&mdash;and
not only with the blood of an Oddi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
shed by a fierce Baglione, the two leading
families always fighting for power in
their city: the one party being Guelph,
and the other Ghibelline.</p>

<p>There was even worse strife than
this: at times near and dear kinsmen
fought hand to hand in the constant
brawls of Perugia; murder was done
in the churches, even before the high
altar of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Softer, quainter memories, however,
linger in this hill-throned and hill-girdled
city, and permeate the atmosphere,
in spite of the "reek of blood"
which, a poet once told me, "taints
Perugia."</p>

<p>Up the brick-stepped way, beneath
a tall dark arch, came, even in those
years of rapine and murder, the grave
Urbino painter, Giovanni Sanzio, with
his fair-haired son, Raffaelle. Giovanni
came to Perugia to place the lad with
the illiterate genius of Città del Pieve,
Pietro Vannucci, whose praise was in
every one's mouth, and who had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
set up a school and was ranked a great
painter. The Perugians still fondly call
him "il nostro Perugino." It is said
that Pietro was born in the ancient
hill-city.</p>

<p>One feels sure that Raffaelle must
have been petted and tenderly loved.
The father and son made a striking
picture as they came from the dark
archway into the sunlight,&mdash;Raffaelle
mounted on his mule, his dainty locks
falling over his shoulders in glossy waves
of brightness.</p>

<p>Years before he came, the sun saw
a very different picture, when poor,
roughly clad, coarse-featured Cristoforo
Vannucci came trudging along on foot
from Città del Pieve, holding the
red fist of his little son, Pietro. The
square-faced, square-headed boy was
only eleven years old, yet his father
already firmly believed in his genius,
and had brought him all the way
from Città del Pieve to present him
to the great Umbrian master, Benedetto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
Bonfigli, who was then at work
on the famous frescoes still to be seen
in the Palazzo Pubblico of Perugia.
There are, both in the Sala del Cambio
and elsewhere in the city, proofs that
Raffaelle actually worked here, and
that he studied under Perugino with
Pinturicchio, Lo Spagna, Eusebio di
San Giorgio, and the great master's
other pupils.</p>

<p>One learns in Perugia how the student
from Città del Pieve raised the tone
and widened the scope of the existing
Umbrian school, and gave to it a grace
and ease, to say nothing of higher
qualities, which have rarely been excelled.
Yet, except in the frescoes of
the beautiful Sala del Cambio, much
of Perugino's best work is to be found
elsewhere, rather than in the town
wherein he established his academy,
and from which he took his name as
a painter.</p>

<p>The southern side of the city holds a
still more absorbing association in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
gate near the old church and convent
of San Pietro de Casinensi; for by
this gate is the way to Assisi, and it
has often been trodden by Francesco
Bernardone and his disciples.</p>

<p>But I am straying from my text:
the mysterious fascination which the
grey old city on the hill has for those
who linger in it.</p>

<p>I have been told that some travellers
"do" Perugia in six hours, or between
trains; I have heard the Via Appia
compared with the Holborn Viaduct;
but these travellers do not come under
the spell of the place; they see only
an old city, part Etruscan, part Roman,
chiefly mediæval, perched on top of
a hill, girt with massive walls which
look down thirteen hundred feet and
more, to the fertile valley of the
Tiber.</p>

<p>The steep slopes as they descend are
in summer-time silver with olive-groves,
golden with plots of maize; later on
they are studies of golden-green and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
yellow, with richly festooned vines laden
with fruit.</p>

<p>These rapid travellers may, perhaps,
admire the triple ranges of purple
Apennines that on every side form a
varied background to this picturesque
fertility, and to the lesser hills below
them, spurs projecting boldly forward
into the deep valley, above which the
old city shows her towers and massive
walls; they will, perhaps, notice, as
they go downhill again, how quaintly
the wall is carried in and out, starwise,
as it follows the indentations of the
hills, and how boldly at each projecting
angle a warmly tinted tower
stands out against the sky. They can
hardly fail to observe these salient
features; but they will not have time
to study the varied form of each hill,
or to watch the sun set opposite grand
old Monte Subasio.</p>

<p>That is a sight worth going far to
see; the intense glow dyes the white
houses of Assisi as they cling to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>
mountain-side, a pale rose against the
flame-like orange tint that seems to
burn in the very heart of Subasio,
rather than to be reflected from the
opposite side of the horizon.</p>

<p>And the hurrying travellers will not
have time to enjoy the charming drives
among the olives in the valley, or to
visit the many places of interest which
can be reached from Perugia. They
go home, and say, "Oh yes, we saw
Perugia,&mdash;a dull old city, without a
shop worth looking into."</p>

<p>A part of the indescribable fascination
of the place is felt in long wanderings
through the narrow streets, often deeply
shadowed by tall palaces with grated
windows and bricked-up doorways.</p>

<p>Come with me under a lofty archway,
made with uncemented stones
on either side, so huge that surely
giants must have placed them in position.
Now we are in a vaulted way,
beneath ancient houses built over the
street; these archways are frequent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
sometimes low-browed and round-headed,
mere tunnels through which
one almost gropes one's way, and finds
at the farther end a sudden descent
down a flight of half-ruined brick steps,
which turn so quickly that a keen
interest insists they must be followed
to the end. Sometimes the arch is
Etruscan, tall and pointed, and instead
of a descent, steps go upwards to
another lofty archway with a darkness
beyond it that still beckons on the
explorer.</p>

<p>Day after day I have wandered up
and down those twisting, hilly streets,
often losing my way, and as often
stumbling upon some fresh interest;
some portion of Etruscan wall, or some
exquisite point of view; a vista at the
far-off end of a street, and often when
this is arrived at, a grander and more
varied picture, with part of Perugia
for foreground.</p>

<p>One may easily lose one's way in
Perugia. At first the city seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>
us a hopeless maze of twisting streets;
but after a little we succeeded in
realising the peculiarity of its form.
It is said to be that of a star; but it
is more like a lobster, with its head
on one side, and outstretched tail and
claws; or it is like a comet with star-shaped
sides, the head on its long neck
inclined westward, and a longer tail
pointing south-east.</p>

<p>A great charm for those who stay
in this city is the comfortable, home-like
resting-place to be found in the
Hotel Brufani. On our first visit this
hotel was in progress of erection, but
its predecessor existed in the house on
the spur of the hill, outside the city
gates. We have been told that the
Albergo di Belle Arti is both very
comfortable and moderate.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the delight
of that first arrival.</p>

<p>The heat was so intense in Tuscany
that we could not travel in daytime,
so we left Florence at night, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
a dull, sleepy journey, arriving at
Perugia towards morning.</p>

<p>As we came into the hall and the
long corridor of the hotel, the dim
light fell mysteriously on plants and
flowers, showing curios on the wall
behind them; to our joy, when we
reached our charming cool room and
opened the persiennes, we saw the
exquisite light of early morning crowning
the dim, far-off hills.</p>

<p>The day dawned golden with sunshine,
the air breathed a delightful
freshness. We strolled into the garden,
which had at one end two majestic
aloes in full bloom and a group of
sun-flowers. Oleanders, covered with
rosy blossoms, stood at the garden
entrance; beyond was a bower of
golden-green acacias, wreathed to their
topmost branches with blue and white
morning glories; below us we saw a
varied landscape, the distant hills tinted
with delicate morning light.</p>

<p>We found our quarters delightful, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
our host and hostess full of attentive
kindness. This was continued when the
hotel removed to its present quarters
in the large house at the beginning of
the city. The views from the Brufani
Hotel terrace and windows are superb;
they command both the Val di Tevere
and several points of the town itself.</p>

<p>Alas! both our good hosts, Signor and
Madame Brufani, have passed away,
but the well-arranged house remains,
and is said to be very comfortable still.</p>

<span class="s08">MARKET-DAY IN PERUGIA</span></h2>

<img src="images/i_b_013.jpg" width="122" height="154" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RAFFAELLE.</p>
</div>

<p>The day after our arrival we
went up some steps near
the hotel, bordered by
aloes not yet in bloom,
and gemmed with brilliant-eyed
lizards darting in and
out in the sunshine; presently we found
ourselves under the lofty walls that once
supported the fortress built by command
of Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span>, on the site of the
Baglioni palaces. In this wall is bricked
up an ancient Etruscan gate&mdash;the Porta
Marzia, which came in the way of this
erection.</p>

<p>One is glad, for the sake of freedom,
to think that not so many years ago
the citizens of Perugia pulled down
and utterly destroyed this hated fortress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
set up by the tyrant Pope when
the hill-city submitted to his dominion.</p>

<p>From a picturesque point of view,
the fortress was probably more in
harmony with the old streets behind
it, especially with the frowning walls,
than are the modern buildings that
now border the new Piazza Vittor
Emanuele, and take off the charm of
approach on this side.</p>

<p>One need not, however, enter Perugia
by way of Piazza Vittor Emanuele.
Keeping below the huge wall, beside
an avenue of green acacias, we climbed
by a wide flight of shallow brick steps
past the picturesque church of San
Ercolano, then went through a lofty
archway, with huge projecting imposts,
into a street with tall, grey houses on
either side.</p>

<p>One of these was evidently the back
of a palace, and indeed it forms part of
the Palazzo Baglione which fronts the
next street, Via Riario; the very name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
Baglione made one shiver, remembering
the chronicles of that bloodthirsty race.</p>

<p>We halted here before a shop, to
its owner, a well-to-do merchant of
Perugia, we had been given an introduction;
he most courteously offered to
show us his wine cellar, in which
is a portion of the veritable Etruscan
wall of Perugia, in excellent preservation.
Some of the stones are about
thirteen feet long and eighteen inches
thick, huge uncemented blocks of travertine.
The floor of the cellar is formed
by the ancient way, so that one actually
treads the road used by Etruscans
before Rome was thought of!</p>

<p>The amount of forced labour represented
by these walls of Perugia is
painful to think of, for the stones in
the merchant's cellar must have been
brought from a very great distance. The
blocks of travertine are certainly the
finest specimens we saw in the city. The
old wall went on from them by way of
the Porta Marzia to the Porta Eburnea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
then northwards (there are visible fragments
of it in the Rione Eburnea) till
it reached the famous arch near the
Piazza Grimani, and so on eastward to
Monte Sole, where it took a southern
course again, to join the remains in
Signor Betti's cellar.</p>

<p>The house stands on the edge of the
hill, and from its back windows there is
an extended view over the country on
that side, and, looking south, over the
garden of San Pietro de Casinensi, then
kept in order by the boys of the reformatory.
The fine old machicolated spire
of San Pietro and the quaint campanile
of San Domenico are striking landmarks
from the high road winding out
to the Tiber and Ponte San Giovanni.</p>

<p>We discovered one secret in the
charm of Perugia when we turned from
this lovely and varied landscape to the
vivid contrast offered by the old grey
street.</p>
<div class="fig_red_side p4"><a name="i_b_016fp" id="i_b_016fp"></a>

<p class="drop-cap">SAN DOMENICO<br />
<i>PERUGIA</i></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Near to Signor Betti's house is a
little curiosity shop, and in its window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
was a proof that the belief in "mal
occhio" still exists among the peasants.
Hanging from a rough brass watch chain,
much the worse for wear, was a little
bunch of hairs from a horse's tail, set
as a charm, and considered to be a
specific against "mal occhio," or any
spell cast on horses, cows, etc. Near it
was an irregular, stumpy bit of coral, a
man's safeguard against a like disaster.</p>

<p>During our stay in Perugia we made
acquaintance with Signor Bellucci, a
very learned and courteous professor
of the university, who most kindly
showed us in his rooms, not only a
very interesting and valuable collection
of implements and other articles, beginning
at the Stone Age, but also a collection
of amulets and charms. Some of
these, especially those for protection
from lightning, are bits of prehistoric
stones, and exhibit a grotesque mingling
of pagan and mediæval superstition.</p>

<p>A little case embroidered with the
Agnus Dei contained a triangular stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>
arrow-head, and this, the Professor said,
used to be hung at the bed-head of the
owner, between pictures of saints; on
the occasion of a storm, candles were
lighted, and prayers were offered before
the amulet.</p>

<p>This collection of charms amounts to
nearly two hundred specimens; it is full
of interest, and it would require many
pages to do it justice.</p>

<p>A very curious amulet was the fragment
of a human skull enclosed in a
little brass reliquary, considered to be a
sovereign protection against epilepsy and
kindred disorders. Tradition said that
this bit of bone had belonged to the
skull of a person, dead some two hundred
years before, who had worked so many
wonderful cures by his skill in medicine,
and had lived such a long and saintly
life, that he had been loved and venerated
by all.</p>

<p>The Professor told us it was not uncommon,
when a body was dug up in
the course of excavations, to find a bit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
of the skull missing, and this amulet
doubtless explained the use that had
been made of such lost fragments.</p>

<p>Another charm was a little cross of
holly-wood carved by Capuchin friars;
it had been found hanging at an old
woman's bed-head, to protect her from
the spells of a witch. She would only
part from it on condition that she
might reserve some splinters of the
wood, so as to prevent the witch from
visiting her, and tormenting her for
having parted from her safeguard.</p>

<p>In Brittany we often saw a branch of
holly hanging beside the bed for the
same purpose. There were corals in this
Perugian collection of various shapes, for
women and children, for safety in teething,
for protection against "mal occhio,"
to stop bleeding, and above all, for the
cure of melancholy. The dark stone
with red spots, which I have heard
called in England bloodstone, is said
to be infallible in checking bleeding; it
must be useful in a country where blood-letting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
and leeching are still common
and frequent remedies.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing of the
charms was a heart-shaped agate with
a hole through the top. This was found
in a house not far from Perugia, where
from time immemorial it had been
held in reverence, and in which its
influence was supposed to have maintained
perfect harmony among the inmates
of the house. Professor Bellucci
did not tell us why its possessors were
willing to give it up: did they want
a little change from this perpetual
harmony?</p>

<p>Belief in witches is still very prevalent
in Umbria. They are said to haunt
cross-roads persistently at night-time, it
is also said that he who walks late in
the environs of Perugia will do well to
carry a few small coins in his pocket,
and to fling them abroad as an offering
when he comes near to a cross-road, for
assuredly a witch lies there in ambush,
ready to work him harm. Also, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
the traveller sees in some unfrequented
by-road a heap of stones beside the way,
he must at once add another stone to
this cairn, so that he may keep down
the phantom of the murdered traveller,
whose unblessed body has been hastily
put underground in the lonely spot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_021" id="i_b_021"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_021.jpg" width="307" height="396" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FOUNTAIN OUTSIDE SAN DOMENICO.</p>
</div>

<p>Among these ciottoli, however, I did
not see any of the charming little coral
hands to be found farther south, with
the forefinger and little finger, the other
fingers closed, pointed in defence against
"mal occhio." It is possible that this
belief in the virtue of coral may have
originated the custom of the long coral
necklace so frequently worn by the
peasant women of Umbria.</p>

<p>San Domenico is near the Professor's
house; a flight of steps leads up to the
church, and before it is a fountain
bearing on its side the Griffin of Perugia.
The lofty campanile makes this church
conspicuous from every part of the
city. It must have been tall, indeed,
before the tyrannical Pope ordered its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
two upper storeys to be demolished.
The original church is said to have been
built early in the fourteenth century,
from the designs of Giovanni Pisano; it
was, however, almost all rebuilt three
centuries later. The very large and
richly coloured east window, and the
beautiful tomb with its remarkable
canopy, were both in the first church.
The tomb, that of Pope Benedict <span class="smcap">XI</span>.,
who died in Perugia from eating poisoned
figs, is the work of Giovanni Pisano.
Some intarsia work in the choir stalls is
very good, but with this exception, and
the Pope's monument, San Domenico is
not nearly so interesting as San Pietro
de' Casinensi.</p>

<p>Past the little Gothic church of San
Ercolano, and a line of acacias with exquisite
yellow-green foliage, the tender
greys of the city seemed suddenly galvanised
into vivacious colour, for Piazza
Sopra Mura was thronged with merry
chattering crowds of market buyers and
sellers; many of the handsome peasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
women standing or sitting behind their
wares wore a necklace of coral beads.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_025" id="i_b_025"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_025.jpg" width="402" height="349" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PIAZZA SOPRA MURA.</p>
</div>

<p>This long Piazza is built on substructures
which connect the two hills on
which Perugia stands; these substructures
are said to be in some places
built on the foundation of the Etruscan
wall. The Piazza itself is full of
infinite variety: on the right are two
quaint grey mediæval palaces, with
balconies and windows; the Palazzo
del Capitano del Popolo or del Podestà,
and the ancient university, are now
used as Law Courts. One can fancy
the sometimes inflammatory, sometimes
soothing discourses that have been pronounced
from the ringhiera of the ancient
Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo. Nearly
opposite this building stands a fountain.
The laughing, gesticulating, ever-moving
crowd in the market-place, and the
brilliant hues of tomatoes, melons, and
vegetables, made one's eyes ache. There
was a certain sobriety in the colour of
the women's gowns, for the most part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
pale lilac or yellow cotton prints, with
sometimes white jackets enlivened by
the favourite necklace of coral beads.</p>

<p>The dark eyes, brilliant skins, and the
red-gold hair of many of these women
actually seemed to burn under the gay
flower-like headkerchiefs, which looked
at a little distance like some huge tulip-bed,
so bright was the orange, chocolate,
scarlet, and rose colour mingled with
white and green. The laughing women
mostly showed white, even teeth. The
buzz of talk and laughter was so gay
and animated that one wondered they
could manage the buying and selling
in such a hubbub.</p>

<p>We especially noticed an old dame,
her white hair showing under a gay
kerchief with a sea-green border, and
a bunch of roses in the corner hanging
behind her head. She too had a long
string of coral, that set off the orange-brown
of her skin and her clear blue
eyes. Her features were regular; she
had not lost her teeth, so that the form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
of her mouth was still good. She had
been bargaining and gesticulating with
a dark lustrous-eyed girl, with blue-black
hair, for a pair of snowy struggling
pigeons, and when she went back to her
place behind a basket of ripe figs she
moved like an old Juno.</p>

<p>Some of the young women were singularly
handsome. Among these peasants
and the people of Perugia we noticed
two distinct types of face: regular
features and deeply set eyes, like the
faces in the old tomb of the Volumni,
were frequent; some of these faces had
blue eyes and beautiful red-gold hair,
and were set on round pillar-like throats
and well-developed figures. Others&mdash;and
perhaps the greater number of the
town shop-keeping class&mdash;had a far less
refined type of face, turned-up noses
and sensual mouths; though many of
them were very attractive, especially
when they wore the graceful black lace
mantilla, so well suited to their brilliant
complexions, dark shining eyes, and full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>
red lips. Some of the men were also
handsome, but not so well grown as the
women were.</p>

<p>Probably the custom of carrying a
huge basket or a tall pitcher on her head,
up and down the hills and hilly streets,
gives to the peasant woman in Umbria
the stately grace that distinguishes her
movements.</p>

<p>These peasants seem to take an interest
in foreigners, and are much pleased to
be spoken to by them. One girl who
kept a handkerchief stall greatly amused
us. I had been trying to bargain with
her for some of her gaily-coloured wares,
but she asked such a price that I turned
away; she came after me, almost crying:</p>

<p>"If the signora will explain her ideas
on the subject, we may be able to
arrange," she said.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that we met with
much courtesy and fair dealing in
Perugia. Even at the fruit-stalls, where
we stood studying heaps of lemons,
full of colour from bluish green to most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>
golden of yellows, the owner left us in
peace, and seemed pleased that we
should take our fill of gazing.</p>

<p>But the market is soon over; the
baskets empty quickly; the unhappy
turkeys and cocks and hens, tied by the
feet, are soon handed over head downwards
to fresh owners; the lemon heaps,
some exquisitely green, with a leaf or
so hanging from the fruit stalks, have
dwindled till the remaining fruit lies
flat on the large board near the fountain;
of the scarlet army of tomatoes not one
is left, and all the cool, pink-fleshed
slices of water melon, sown with black
seeds, have disappeared.

<p>The next morning we took our
way up a side turning into
the Corso, the handsomest
street in Perugia. The shop
windows had the day before
been made extra gay, to attract
the market-sellers; they still showed
long strings of cut coral beads.</p>

<p>There is a mass of fine, as well as
interesting, fourteenth century building
on the left of the Corso: the Collegio del
Cambio, and the Palazzo del Pubblico,
or, as it is also called, Palazzo Comunale.
This has a richly-sculptured doorway,
and ends on the Piazza del Duomo;
it has quaint iron lamps. On this
Piazza, and facing us, we saw the unfinished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
stone and brick work of the
Cathedral, San Lorenzo, with its outside
pulpit, from which St. Bernardino
preached to the people.</p>

<p>On the left stands the Palace called
the Canonica or Seminary, with its
cloisters. This belonged to the clergy,
and was the dwelling of those Popes
who stayed in Perugia during their
visits to the city, so greatly beloved
and coveted by the Holy See.</p>
<div class="fig_red_side p4"><a name="i_b_032fp" id="i_b_032fp"></a>

<p class="drop-cap">THE GREAT
FOUNTAIN<br />
<i>PIAZZA DEL DUOMO</i></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">In the centre of the Piazza stands the
famous fountain usually ascribed to
Nicolo Pisano, but said to have been
designed by Fra Bevignate, a native
of the city. However, the great Pisan
sculptor and his son Giovanni made
the two large marble basins, and sculptured
the panels which decorate them.
Nicolo, whose quaint costume is given
in the initial, is said to have sculptured
the twenty-four statues, now dark with
age, but remarkable for the sharpness
of their exquisite carving; two of the
statues are, however, restorations. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
delicate bas-reliefs of the second basin
are ascribed to Giovanni Pisano, and are
full of variety; the upper basin, with
nymphs and lions and the inevitable
griffin of Perugia, is supposed to have
been cast in bronze by Rossi; water
no longer plays from this fountain. It
is very beautiful, but it wears a sad
and desolate aspect, in perfect harmony
with the terrible tragedies which have
been so often enacted on this square.</p>

<p>The finest side of the Palazzo Pubblico
is that which faces the Cathedral; it has
a charming loggia and a grand double
flight of steps guarded by the Guelphic
lion and the Perugian griffin. There
are still traces on this fine old wall
showing where the keys of two cities,
Siena and Assisi, were hung in chains
by the arrogant Perugians, till, in one of
the attacks on the city, some mercenary
soldiers wrenched them away. The
griffin, the quaint emblem of Perugia,
is to be found repeated in all the decorative
work of the city. The Palazzo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
Pubblico was built early in the fourteenth
century from the design of the Benedictine,
Fra Bevignate. The heads of
criminals used to be fixed on the steel
lances which project from it. When
the criminals had been guilty of treason
their heads were hung downwards. It
was a custom in Perugia to confine
criminals in an iron cage hung on this
old wall, the miserable creatures being
left to starve to death in the cage!
The horrible dungeons below can still
be seen; they give one some idea of
the cruelties enacted in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>The cathedral of San Lorenzo, on the
Piazza del Duomo, is spacious rather
than interesting, except for its associations:
three Popes who died in Perugia
are buried in one tomb in a transept,
and in a chapel is preserved the marriage-ring
of the Blessed Virgin. We noticed
some good wood carving in the stalls.</p>

<p>On the right, beyond the cathedral
and its square, is the little Piazza del
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
Papa. On this a bronze statue, vivid
green in colour, is raised high on a
pedestal. An inscription tells that the
statue represents Pope Julius <span class="smcap">III</span>., and
is the work of Vincenzo Danti.</p>

<p class="caption">BRONZE STATUE OF<br />
POPE JULIUS III.</p>
</div>

<p>The grand old Pope has been sitting
enthroned outside
the cathedral doors
for more than three
hundred years, with
hand outstretched,
in the act of blessing.
It almost
seems that during
these long years
the golden sunshine,
mingled with the
intense blue of the
sky, has created the
brilliant colour of the bronze, this vivid
green which rivals that of the lizards
as they dart in and out of the grey old
wall behind the Duomo.</p>

<p>Looking at the old Pope under different
aspects,&mdash;in the sparkle of morning sunshine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>
in its full meridian glow, or in the
gloom that comes to Perugia so swiftly
at the heels of day,&mdash;one gets to see
a different expression in the Pontiff's
immovable face.</p>

<p>In the morning it beams on the
crowd of crockery sellers, and their
wares spread out on the stones around
its pedestal, and points proudly to the
grand group presented by the fountain
and the Palazzo Comunale; at midday
the expression is harder; but at eventide
a pensive cast comes over the
face, more in keeping with the grass-grown
street behind the statue, and
the ancient grey palaces.</p>

<p>This bronze Pope, Julius <span class="smcap">III.</span>, was not
sitting here at the time of the famous
preaching of San Bernardino of Siena,
on the Piazza del Duomo, when the
Perugians flung their grandest vanities
into a heap and burned them as a proof
of penitence, as the Tuscans did at
Florence in the days of Savonarola.
This preaching of San Bernardino is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>
commemorated in an old but restored
window in the cathedral.</p>

<p>Behind the adjoining Piazza dei Gigli,
an open square in front of the Sorbello
Palazzo, is a way going steeply upwards
to the right; it has bricked steps in the
middle, but at the side of these is a long
strip of ascending slope, so irregularly
paved that it might serve as a specimen
pattern of the variously paved streets
in the town. Tufts of grass between the
stones show that this way is not much
used. Its right side is walled by the
church of Santa Maria Nuova, and high
above it on the left are some quaint
houses. This road leads to San Severo,
a little chapel containing what is called
Raffaelle's first fresco, unhappily very
much restored. The view of the country
between the houses near it is more
interesting than the painting.</p>

<p>This is a very old part of the town;
presently, through a tunnel under a
low-browed arch, we came out on the
Piazza of Monte Sole, surrounded by old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
palaces. This Piazza marks the summit
of one of the two hills on which ancient
Perugia was built by the Etruscans;
the other hill, Colle Landone, is crowned
by Palazzo Donnini, and till the time
of wise and valiant Forte Braccio, who,
though cruel, seems to have been the
best ruler the Perugians can boast of,
the valley between these two hills
existed.</p>

<p>Forte Braccio caused it to be filled
up, and the Piazza Sopra Mura, where
the weekly market is held, takes its
name from the levelling and sub-structures
then effected.</p>

<p>It was from Piazza Monte Sole that
the despotic Abbot Monmaggiore fled
along the covered way he had made to
connect his citadel of Monte Sole with
his palaces at Porta San Antonio. On
this occasion the nobles joined hands
with the citizens against the conspiring
French priest, drove the foreigners out
of the city, and for the time freed
Perugia from the hated Papal yoke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>

<p>Going on from the Piazza Monte Sole,
a few steps bring us to a tree-shaded
terrace with benches placed along it.
There is a grand view from the wall
that bounds the terrace, and seems to
go straight down into the valley. Just
below is the red cupola-topped church
of Santa Maria Nuova, while the houses
of the town lay thickly clustered
below. The ancient wall from which
we now gaze runs out northward on
the right, and on the left goes on till
it reaches the famous Etruscan arch
near the Piazza Grimani. Beyond are
the heights, on one of which stands the
convent of San Francesco, outside the
extreme northern point marked by the
gate of San Angelo; from this we get
a glimpse of Subasio. Going out behind
the terrace we see the Duomo close by,
and soon find our way back to the
Corso.</p>

<p>Perugia was never weak; rather she
was in all things powerful, and she
produced a race of the most renowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
Condottieri of Italy, the bloodthirsty
Baglioni. Had the brutal nobles and the
proud citizens been able to control their
passions, and to discipline their ambition;
had they been able to behave, in
fact, like Christians, Perugia might have
held sovereign sway in Umbria.</p>

<p>Instead of this, though nominally
governed by the Podestà, or chief magistrate
and the Priori, she was frequently
forced to defend herself against Papal
plots and aggression; almost constantly
against the tyranny of her rival nobles,
and the mischiefs caused by their brawls
between themselves, and with the Raspanti,
among whom were the richest and
most powerful of the citizens.</p>

<p>Through these centuries, from the
thirteenth to the sixteenth, the Piazza
del Duomo often ran with blood. It
was the chief scene of the fierce struggles
which make the eventful history of the
hill-city; for until the time of Paul the
Third, Perugia never entirely submitted
to the personal sway of an alien ruler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
though she frequently banished both
nobles and Raspanti.</p>

<p>There was a short period of comparative
peace when, in the fourteenth
century, the Condottiere Biordo Michelotti
entered the city at the head of the
banished Raspanti, and became supreme
ruler in the name of the people. Broils
were still frequent between the nobles
and the plebs, but Biordo was the first
of the brigand despots who tried to
free Perugia from Papal encroachments.</p>

<p>Warlike, wicked Guidalotti, Abbot of
San Pietro, jealously watched the Captain's
success, and justly estimated his
power; he resolved to end it, and to
restore the influence of the Holy See in
Perugia.</p>

<p>Biordo, a valiant, hard-working ruler,
had asked in marriage the beautiful
Lucrezia Orsini, with whom he hoped,
now that the city enjoyed comparative
quiet, to end his days in peace. The
Abbot thought that these bridal festivities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
would give him the opportunity he
sought.</p>

<p>A few days after the marriage the
wily priest rode up from San Pietro
on horseback to the higher part of
the town. He here collected his bravi
together, and rode on to Michelotti's
palace on Monte Sole. As soon as
Michelotti came down to greet his visitor
the Abbot put his arm round him and
kissed him. At this signal the other
ruffians at once attacked the unarmed
governor, and killed him with their
poisoned daggers.</p>

<p>After Biordo Michelotti, came early in
the next century the valiant and wise
Forte Braccio, who greatly improved
the condition of the city, and repressed
licence and disorder. But this brave
(though cruel) soldier and sagacious ruler
was defeated in battle, and died from
the wounds he received. This was a
terrible loss; it alarmed the Perugians,
for though Forte Braccio was of noble
birth, being Conte di Montone, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>
protected the city against the outrages
of the fierce and brutal Oddi, Baglioni,
Corgna, and others. The citizens, in
their despair at the loss of their ruler,
made overtures to Pope Martin, who
received them with open arms.</p>

<p>At this the nobles felt all their power
restored; they knew the Pope would side
with them against the people, and, quitting
their houses in the country around
the city, they established themselves in
palaces chiefly in the vicinity of Porta
Marzia, whence it was easy to overawe
the town.</p>

<p>After Forte Braccio's death, one of his
soldiers, a singularly brave and capable
man, named Nicola Piccinino, tried to
wrest supreme power both from the
Pope and the nobles. The Perugians
suffered terribly, for, while the long
struggle lasted, the Pope, the nobles,
and Piccinino, who was liked by the
people and idolised by the army, all
levied taxes on them; Nicola at last
ceased his efforts to attain supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
power, and accepted from the Pope the
post of Gonfalionere, chief magistrate of
the city, in the pontiff's name.</p>

<p>The nobles at this period were left
unhindered to brawl as they pleased.
The Baglioni, a race of men so renowned
for crime, strength, bravery, and beauty,
that they recall the heroes of the <i>Iliad</i>,
and one wonders whether the old pagans
were not better men than those so-called
Christians, were always at war with the
Oddi, till at last they worsted their
rivals, and drove them out of Perugia;
then they fell out among themselves.
During their last struggle with the Oddi
they took possession of the cathedral and
fortified it.</p>

<p>After the banishment of the Oddi
the power of the Baglioni greatly increased;
it became almost supreme.
The Pope had given them the lordship
of Spello; they also owned Spoleto, and
some others of the hill-cities of Umbria.
These possessions brought them great
wealth. They were cruel and tyrannical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>
despots; they appointed civic officials;
it was even said that no legate ventured
to visit the city unless he was a friend
of the Baglioni.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the fifteenth
century some of the poorer and more
obscure members of this powerful clan,
or, as the old chronicler Matarazzo terms
them, "beautiful Baglioni," murmured
loudly against their richer kinsfolk.
They were just as indolent, just as brutal
and licentious, and in proportion to their
means fully as arrogant and prodigal.
But people were not afraid of them;
they had neither wealth to keep bravi
with, nor influence to support and
further their pretensions. These poor
relations could no longer endure their
dependent position; they saw that if the
sons of the elder house were disposed
of, they should have a chance of
coming to their own. At present they
were completely shadowed by the wealth
and haughty self-assertion of their
cousins; they also coveted their possessions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
and longed to divide them among
themselves.</p>

<p>The heads of the Baglione house were
the two brothers, Guido and Ridolfo.
Guido had five stalwart sons, as much
noted for their prowess and heroic
bravery, as for their good looks; these
were Astorre, Adriano (usually called
Morgante, because of his wonderful
strength), Marcantonio, Gismondo, and
Gentile. Ridolfo's sons were Troilo,
Gianpaolo, and Simonetto.</p>

<p>Besides the splendid sons of Guido
and Ridolfo, there was yet another very
wealthy and distinguished scion of the
Baglione family, their young cousin
Grifonetto. He was happily married to
a young and beautiful wife, and was on
friendly terms with all his cousins. His
father, Grifone, had died young in battle;
his still young and lovely mother, Atalanta
Baglione, was extremely rich. She so
greatly loved Grifonetto, her only child,
that she remained a widow for his sake,
and gave up her own home to live with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
him and his fair young wife, Zenobia
Sforza, in the splendid palace he had
built near Porta Marzia.</p>

<p>A few years before the end of the
fifteenth century, the banished Oddi
faction thought fit to attack the city;
they rode suddenly in through the gates,
and began to strike at the chains stretched
across the street for defence against
sudden attacks. The first to give the
alarm was Simonetto Baglione, a young
and beardless youth, who, though of a
fierce and cruel nature, was heroically
brave. He rushed forth in his shirt,
armed only with sword and shield, and
held the squadron of advancing Oddi at
bay before the barrier that defended the
Piazza. Soon ten of his adversaries
lay dead at his feet. Till he had killed
many more he persevered in attacking
the foe with intense fury, until he had
received twenty-two wounds. Then his
cousin Astorre rode forth to help him.
"Go and tend your wounds, Simonetto,"
he cried, and dashed at the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
enemy; a falcon flashed on his gilded
helmet, with the griffin's tail sweeping
behind it. At once he became a target
for the Oddi, their blows fell so thick
and fast that each hindered the other
from striking truly; nothing could be
heard above the din of the strokes made
by lances, partizans, crossbow quarries,
and other weapons falling on Astorre's
body; the sound of those great blows
overbore the noise and shouting of the
combatants. But the noble Astorre was
undismayed by the horrid clamour, he
rode his horse into the thickest of the
fight, and trampled the Oddi under
foot; while his horse, being a most
fierce animal, gave the enemy what
trouble it could, for so soon as they were
jostled and overthrown by his rider,
the beast trampled on them. By the
time that the other Baglioni heroes
sallied forth to help him, Astorre and
his war-horse were overdone, they could
scarce breathe.</p>

<p>The Oddi were again driven from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
city, but a war followed which devastated
the fertile country between Perugia and
Assisi.</p>

<p class="p2">All through these fearful times of
strife and bloodshed Art was progressing
quietly and surely in Perugia. Raffaelle
was at this time working in the atelier
of Perugino, and it is thought that
he must have witnessed this splendid
defence of Astorre Baglione, and that
he afterwards reproduced the young
warrior, his helmet crowned by a falcon
and tail of griffin, in the St. George of
the Louvre, and the trampling horseman
in the Heliodorus Stanza of the Vatican.</p>

<p>After this achievement the Baglioni
seem to have had a short time of family
peace. This was soon interrupted. Grifonetto's
wealth, the splendid palace in
which he lived with his lovely mother
and Zenobia Sforza, his beautiful wife,
helped to make him, young though he
was, the most powerful member of the
family. He and his wife dearly loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
each other, and the chronicler says, "No
wonder, for they were as beautiful as
angels." But for evil counsellors, and
the restless ambition of the Baglioni,
this state of affairs might have lasted.
Three of the evil and disappointed
relatives clung to Grifonetto like limpets;
these were his uncle Filippo, his
cousin Carlo Baciglia Baglione, and a
scandalously dissolute scoundrel named
Jeronimo della Penna or Arciprete. They
took counsel together as to how the
sons of Guido and Ridolfo Baglione
could be easiest put out of the way,
so that their wealth and power might be
divided among the conspirators. Too
poor and of too ill-repute to act alone,
they saw that their patron Grifonetto
had all they lacked, and they resolved
to persuade him to head their conspiracy.
At first they strove to win
him by the offer of supreme power in
Perugia; he could revolt, they said,
against the Papal yoke, and become
sovereign ruler in the city. Grifonetto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
was not ambitious; he had all he
wanted,&mdash;their proposals did not tempt
him.</p>

<p>Astorre was about to wed a Roman
bride, Lavinia, the daughter of a Colonna
father and an Orsini mother, and the
malcontent Baglioni decided that this
marriage, which was to happen at the
end of July, would be a great opportunity
for ridding themselves of their
hated kindred, as it would assemble
every member of the family in Perugia,
except Marcantonio, who, being out of
health, was taking baths at Naples.</p>

<p>The conspirators took fresh counsel
together; the time fixed for the marriage
was now close at hand, they must at once
win over Grifonetto to their schemes.
They therefore told him that Zenobia,
the beautiful wife he so adored, was
unfaithful to him, with his cousin Gianpaolo,
one of the sons of Ridolfo Baglione.</p>

<p>Grifonetto was furious; in his mad
jealousy he believed this story, and
thirsted for vengeance: he consented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
to head the conspiracy, and to rid the
city of the elder branch of his family
by a wholesale murder.</p>

<p>Among the conspirators were Jeronimo
della Staffa, three members of the Corgna
family and others; only two of those
who engaged in this bloodthirsty scheme
were over thirty years old.</p>

<p>The Baglioni were chiefly lodged in
houses on or near the Porta Marzia;
Astorre and his bride, on the night of
the murder, were lodged in the beautiful
palace of Grifonetto, which was the
wonder of Perugia, and always pointed
out to strangers as a marvel of magnificence
both inside and out. Among his
other treasures, Grifonetto possessed a
lion; Astorre and Gianpaolo, the sons of
Guido and Ridolfo Baglione, each owned
one of the royal beasts, and their fearful
roaring at night struck terror to the
hearts of belated Perugians on their way
home.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that as soon
as the proposed victims were asleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
the signal should be given; this was to
be a stone thrown from the loggia of
the Magnifico Guido's palace, into the
court below.</p>

<p>Banquets, jousts, all kinds of magnificent
festivities had gone on for days past.
That night a great supper was given,
at which the conspirators were present;
they appeared to be on the most friendly
terms with the others, and were even
affectionate and caressing to all,&mdash;yet
the traitors had decided who was to
be the murderer of each victim, and
the number of bravi by which each
murderer should be accompanied in case
of resistance.</p>

<p>At last the time arrived. The victims,
heavy with wine, had retired to rest,
they slept undisturbed by the roaring
of the lions. Then the signal was
given; each assassin stood ready at the
appointed door. Carlo Baglione, who
seems to have been the mainspring of
"el gran tradimento," as the chronicler
Matarazzo calls it, made first for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
sleeping-chamber of the head of the
family, the "Magnifico Guido," but he
turned aside to that of young Simonetto.
Jeronimo della Penna forced open the
door of the noble Gismondo; while
Grifonetto himself attacked Gianpaolo,
Filippo di Braccio and one of the
Corgna family unlocked the door of
valiant Astorre, who, asleep with his
newly-married wife, was thus murderously
awakened; the young fellow
opened the door, and, seeing his murderers,
he guessed the truth. As they
attacked him he cried out, "Wretched
Astorre, who dies like a coward." His
young wife rushed up to him, and flung
her arms round him, trying to make her
body a shield between him and his
assailants, but they had already stabbed
him with many more blows than would
have sufficed to kill him, and she too
received a wound. Then the brutal
Filippo di Braccio, seeing how large a
wound was in Astorre's breast, thrust
in his hand, tore out his heart, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
savagely bit it. After this he and his
accomplice flung the body of Astorre
down the stairs and into the street,
where presently the murdered Simonetto
lay beside it. He had wakened, and,
seeing the murderers kill the companion
who lay in his chamber, armed himself,
and fought his way through the villainous
crowd of bravi, till he reached the foot
of the stairs; here fresh assailants despatched
him. Simonetto's uncle Guido
had also time to snatch up his sword; but,
powerful though he was, he was killed.</p>

<p>Grifonetto was less successful than his
fellow-conspirators. Gianpaolo, the most
daring of the elder branch of the Baglioni,
had taken alarm, and so had his squire.
But Gianpaolo was sagacious as well as
brave, and, not knowing who were his
assailants, he bade his squire guard the
staircase which led from his chamber
to the roof, while he tried to escape over
the tops of the other palaces.</p>

<p>The squire fought valiantly, and held
his post for some time,&mdash;the staircase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
turned, and gave him a point of vantage
over his assailants from below. Gianpaolo
reached the roof, and crawled over
it till, coming to the skylight of his cousin
Grifonetto's palace, he had a mind,
in his ignorance as to the conspirators,
to seek shelter there; but he gave up
the idea, and climbed through a window
into another house, owned by one of the
citizens; the good man within was so
terrified at the sight of Baglione, that,
in his fear, he refused to harbour the
great noble. Gianpaolo, going back to
the roof, found his way into the atelier
of some foreign artists, who were also
greatly alarmed at his appearance among
them. One of them, however, named
Achille de la Mandola, seems to have
greatly helped the fugitive.</p>

<p>Gianpaolo finally made his way out
into the street; and soon after out of the
city. Seeing a mule grazing by the wayside,
he at once mounted it, though he
was greatly disturbed to quit Perugia
without having either discovered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
meaning of this night attack, or taken
vengeance on the unknown assassins.
In the meantime day had broken, and
Gentile Baglione, who lived some way
from his father's house, had been also
attacked by the conspirators; he escaped
them at once, by mounting his horse
and riding away. Just as he reached
the bridge beyond the plain, he was
amazed to recognise his elder cousin
Gianpaolo, riding in the same direction
on a mule.</p>

<p>When Atalanta, Grifonetto's beautiful
young mother, heard of the tragedy that
had been acted so close to her, she rose
up, wrapped herself in a large cloak,
and, taking with her the two little sons
of Gianpaolo and her daughter-in-law,
Zenobia Sforza, she quitted her son's
house (she loved Grifonetto so dearly
that she had always lived with him,
having been widowed before she was
twenty) and took refuge in her own
dwelling on the Colle Landone. She
had nothing with her but the cloak she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
wore, and when she learned in detail
the events of the night she solemnly
vowed she would never again cross her
son's threshold. Grifonetto had quickly
repented his crime. His eyes had opened
to the wickedness into which his mad
jealousy had betrayed him. As soon
as he learned his mother's departure
he followed her, but he was refused
admittance; he, however, forced his
way into her presence. She stayed
his approach with outstretched hands,
and delivered her solemn curse on his
guilty head as the murderer of his nearest
kindred. The young fellow fled horror-stricken
from her presence, but soon
returned; he could not find peace, he
said, till his beloved, beautiful mother
forgave him, and removed the curse
she had laid on him.</p>

<p>Atalanta had, however, taken her
precautions, and though the unhappy
Grifonetto went again and again from
his Palazzo to that on the Colle Landone,
Atalanta refused to see or listen to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
With the exception of his complicity
in this fearful tragedy, Grifonetto seems
to have had more human feeling than
some of his cousins of the elder branch.
His suffering under his mother's curse,
and his penitence for his crime, had
completely unnerved him. When Gianpaolo,
who by the death of his
uncle Guido was now the head of the
Baglioni, returned to Perugia with the
troops he and his brothers had rallied
round them, they were met at the city
gate by an excited crowd of citizens;
for though some of the Perugians still
sided with their favourite Grifonetto,
the larger portion abhorred his foul
treason, and longed to see it avenged.
Gianpaolo, seeing the concourse and
hearing the cries of welcome, asked
graciously that the ladies present in
the crowd would be good enough to
pray for his success. They did so, and
sent out, besides, wine to refresh him
and his soldiers after their journey,
before they began to revenge themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
on their enemies. Grifonetto had
come towards the gate with intent to
guard it, gnashing his teeth and weeping,
for he had made another attempt
to see his mother. He presently met
Gianpaolo on the Piazza, where some
of the conspirators had already been
slain,&mdash;Carlo Baglione and Jeronimo della
Penna had a narrow escape by climbing
the city wall.</p>

<p>Gianpaolo gazed with pitying contempt
at his young cousin, who, still
overwhelmed with remorse for his share
in the unnatural crime, and heart-broken
by his mother's curse, was taken aback
at thus suddenly meeting his enemy
within the city.</p>

<p>Gianpaolo rode up, and, pointing his
sword at Grifonetto's throat, cried out;
"Farewell, thou traitor Grifonetto; thou
art"&mdash;Then he added, "Go, in God's
name, for I will not kill you; I will
not dip my hands in your blood, as
you have dipped yours in the blood of
your kindred."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<p>He turned away, making a sign to
his guards, they fell on the stricken
Grifonetto, and wounded him so that
his "graceful limbs" could no longer
support him; he fell in a pool of blood
on the ground. The terrible news was
at once carried to his mother Atalanta,
and his sorrowful wife Zenobia; they
hurried down to the Piazza, and found
their dearly loved Grifonetto not yet
dead, but bleeding from every wound.
His mother fell on her knees beside him;
she assured him of her forgiveness, and
gave him her blessing in place of the
curse she had laid on him. She implored
him to pardon his murderers, and to
give her a sign that he did so. At this
the dying youth clasped the white hand
of his young mother, whom he so dearly
loved, and, pressing it, he expired. "No
words," adds the chronicler, "can paint
the grief of the wife who had so dearly
loved him, or of the mother who had
remained a widow because of her great
love for this adored son. At last they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
rose, stained with the blood that streamed
from him, and ordered his body to be
carried to the hospital."</p>

<p>By this time Gianpaolo and his troops
had returned to the Piazza, bent on
taking a complete revenge on the conspirators
and all enemies of the Baglione
family in Perugia. A fierce battle was
fought on the Piazza, and in the cathedral
itself, for Gianpaolo had caused a large
fire to be kindled before the door, so
as to gain access to the interior; even
those who took refuge at the high
altar were slain there. More than a
hundred persons were murdered by
Gianpaolo's order; the dead bodies lay
where they fell, till the cathedral was
bloodstained from one end to the other.</p>

<p>Then the Magnifico Gianpaolo, being
now the head of the family, took possession
of Grifonetto's palace and of all
the Baglione dwellings which, as has
been said, were near the Porta Marzia.
He gave command that all should be
solemnly hung with black, as a token
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
of mourning for the victims of "el gran
tradimento,"&mdash;a term which Matarazzo
constantly repeats. Gianpaolo also gave
command that the cathedral of San
Lorenzo should be washed with wine
from one end to the other, and then
re-consecrated, to purge it from the
blood shed there during his vengeance
on the slayers of his kindred, and on
all who were in any way unfriendly
to the house of Baglione.</p>

<p>Even Matarazzo, the enthusiastic
admirer of Gian,&mdash;or, as he frequently
calls him, Giovanpaolo,&mdash;bursts into
lamentation over the continued excesses
committed in Perugia till the death of his
hero. The chronicler tells us that from
the time the Oddi were banished there
was no rule in the city, except that of
might against right; every man who was
powerful enough took the law in his own
hands: rapine, murder, plunder, reigned
unchecked. When the Popes, aware of
the persistent excesses, sent now and
again a legate to control and modify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
disorder, and to restore some amount of
security to the dismayed and outraged
citizens, the envoys rarely remained long
enough to interfere, even if they ventured
within the gates of Perugia, lest
they should give offence to the Baglioni,
and be either stabbed or at best flung
out of window.</p>

<p>At last Gianpaolo submitted himself
to the power of the Pope, and though
the Perugians detested Papal government,
they had suffered so severely
under the Baglioni tyranny that they
hailed the prospect of change, especially
as the terms granted them promised
moderation.</p>

<p>Leo the Tenth, however, had little
faith in Gianpaolo Baglione; he therefore
lured him to Rome by sending him
a safe-conduct. On his arrival the Pope
caused him to be imprisoned in the castle
of San Angelo; where he was soon after
beheaded.</p>

<p>Gianpaolo's descendants went from
bad to worse. They were powerful in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
other states besides Perugia; captains
of Condottieri in Venice, in Florence,
also in the States of the Church. One of
them, Malatesta Baglione, proved himself
a most infamous traitor; he sold himself
to Pope Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span>, and, for his
dastardly treason to Florence, was held
up to public execration. The last male
member of this terrible family died in
the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p class="p2">With the accession to the popedom
of Paul the Third came the deathblow
to the freedom of Perugia. He broke
all the treaties as to municipal rights
and privileges, etc., granted by his
predecessors, and built a huge citadel
to overawe the town, actually removing
one of the Etruscan gates, the Porta
Marzia (now restored to its original
site), to make room for his tyrannical
construction. The military despotism
of Pope Paul must have been heartbreaking
to a free, proud people like the
Perugians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span></p>

<p>There seems to have been less bloodshed
under the Papal tyranny, but this
little incident at its beginning, taken
from an old record in the Public Library,
was a savage sort of portent:</p>

<p>"While the Duke Pietro Aloigi stayed
with his troops in Perugia, to order the
new government, Agostino de' Pistoia
and Antonio Romano, two of his soldiers,
asked the Duke's permission to fight out
their quarrel in his presence on the
Piazza of Perugia. The Duke gave
consent, and ordered that they should
fight before the chapel of the Cambio.
There, surrounded by the populace, the
Duke being at one of the windows of the
palace, they fought in their shirts with
swords and daggers.</p>

<p>"Both men showed much courage and
daring, but at last Agostino, of Pistoia,
who was both handsome and tall of
stature, fell on the ground dead.</p>

<p>"Victory was at once cried for Antonio
Romano, who, by his father's side, was
of Perugia; but from the many and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
grievous wounds the Pistonian had given
him, Antonio was considered by many
as good as dead, and was carried home
by his friends. However, by the great
care taken of him, he after a while
recovered his strength."

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="s08">THE COLLEGIO DEL CAMBIO AND THE
PINACOTECA</span></h2>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_069" id="i_b_069"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_069.jpg" width="132" height="157" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PERUGINO.</p>
</div>
<p>The Corso was on the left
near the Fonte grand
range of ancient buildings,
in which is the
entrance to the chapel
of the Cambio; beside
this is the Sala, adorned
with Perugino's famous frescoes. A little
farther on is the richly-sculptured doorway
of the Palazzo Pubblico, and within
this is the Pinacoteca, containing a very
interesting collection of art treasures.
Here are marvellous frescoes by Bonfigli;
and pictures by him and by Piero della
Francesca, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, and
other famous old painters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span></p>

<p>It would be difficult to say too much
in praise of the Sala del Cambio: the
harmony preserved throughout it, in the
rich and artistic decoration of its walls
and ceiling, is most soothing, and adds
greatly to the enjoyment one feels in the
beautiful little place. The lower part of
the walls is wainscotted with dark wood,
inlaid with tarsiatura by Domenico del
Tasso; the doors have the date 1483.
Near the entrance is the raised throne
for the judge; below this are desks and
seats for the money-changers, and these
are exquisitely carved. One account
says that the intarsia designs were
furnished by Raffaelle; another tells
us that Domenico del Tasso was both
designer and executor of this beautiful
work. In the record of the agreement
between the authorities at Perugia and
Pietro Vannucci the painter, he writes,
"My intention in the frescoes which
cover the upper part of the walls is
to recommend the merchants and magistrates
therein assembled never to forsake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
the path of duty, but to remain faithful
to the dictates of wisdom, of natural
reason, and of religion."</p>

<div class="fig_red p4"><a name="i_b_070fp" id="i_b_070fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_070fp.jpg" width="309" height="443" alt="" />
<p class="drop-cap p4">DOORWAY OF PALAZZO PUBBLICO</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Faith and Love are emphasised by
two large frescoes facing the entrance,
the Transfiguration and the Adoration of
the Magi; Hope of an eternal future,
by the prophets and sibyls on the wall
to the right.</p>

<p>On the left wall the frescoes depict
moral qualities,&mdash;Justice and Prudence,
illustrated below by the figures of Fabius
Maximus, Socrates, Numa, Camillus,
Pittacus, and Trajan.</p>

<p>On a lower level still is a portrait in
oil of Perugino, painted by himself; while
the remaining half of the upper wall
has figures representing Courage and
Temperance. Below them are Licinius
Leonidas and Horatius Cocles; Scipio
Africanus, Pericles, and Cincinnatus.</p>

<p>There is not any attempt at grouping
in these frescoes: the figures stand
severe and stately, as if they were on
the look-out to rebuke any cheating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
or covetous practices going on in the
Hall below. It is remarkable that
the painter should have been accused
of greed in the pursuit of his calling,
when he considered it necessary to call
up on the walls of the Sala so many
witnesses to protest against the love
of money in others. The ceiling is
divided into bays, on which are the
planets. In the centre is the sun, represented
by Apollo in his chariot; the
spaces between are filled with ornament
and figures, some of which are attributed
to Raffaelle.</p>

<p>On a bright morning, when the sun
is pouring light and warmth into the
little Sala, the rich tone of these frescoes
is marvellous, and, so far as one can
see, they have not greatly suffered by
restoration.</p>

<p>In the adjoining Cappella del Cambio
are some sibyls and children, said to be
Raffaelle's, but the work in these has
evidently been much retouched.</p>

<p>Perugino is at his best in the frescoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
of the Sala; they form a striking contrast
to the monotony of style which, in
spite of their individual beauty, wearies
one in his Perugian oil pictures. The
gallery devoted to his work upstairs
in the Pinacoteca is, on the whole,
disappointing.</p>

<p>The pictures are calm and sweet and
refined, but one longs for variety of
feeling; a few, however, show marked
superiority over the rest. It is very
curious to remember that these peaceful
saintly pictures were painted when daily
brawls were taking place in the city,
even while her chief Piazza streamed
with the blood of nobles and Raspanti.</p>

<p>The most interesting Umbrian pictures
are those, only a few, by a rare and
early painter, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, who
with Piero della Francesca, from Borgo
del Sepolcro, and Benedetto Bonfigli, had
established a school of art in Perugia.
The lovely head of a Madonna by this
rarely found painter, Fiorenzo di Lorenzo,
is over a doorway in the Palazzo Pubblico,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
and upstairs in one of the galleries
are two very remarkable pictures, the
Adoration of the Magi is especially
beautiful.</p>

<p>The three kings stand on the left,&mdash;one
of them is said to be a portrait,
when young, of Perugino; on the ground,
in the centre, lies the Holy Child; the
Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph kneel on
either side of Him. Opposite the magi
are the ox, and a very wise-looking
ass; while a large group of angels fills
up the background, and forms the most
interesting part of the picture; the
angels are so altogether original and
graceful.</p>

<p>The painting of detail is marvellously
finished, though the similarity of faces
and of costume make it probable that
the same model was used for most of
the angels. They and smaller figures,
the shepherds and others, seen at the
openings which reveal landscape on
either side of the stable, are singularly
full of grace and charm. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
admirable colour in all the pictures by
this painter.</p>

<p>We find paintings by Niccolo Alunno
of Foligno, another contemporary, pictures
too by some old Sienese masters;
a room is filled with small easel pictures
by Fra Angelico. The student of early
Italian art will find in these galleries
abundant material of a most interesting
kind. The pictures were formerly
scattered in the various churches of
Perugia, for which they had been
painted; the government has now
collected and placed them in the Pinacoteca.</p>

<p>One of the rooms leads on to a terrace.
Here is a beautiful view over the surrounding
country. The old cicerone
took much interest in showing us where
Siena and Orvieto and Rome lay, all
three hidden among ranges of blue hills.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="s08">SPELLO</span></h2>

<p>The pleasantest and shortest road to
the railway is by Porta Eburnea.
I started one day from this gate with a
friend, by a steep path which leaves the
road just outside the Porta, and curves
along the side of the hill below the old
wall. The bank, this fine morning, was
gay with butterflies and wild flowers,
and wreathed with a luxuriant growth
of wild gourd, full of pale blossoms
and small furry fruit; all was so wild,
it seemed impossible we had only just
left a busy city behind us.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_078" id="i_b_078"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_078.jpg" width="108" height="183" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE WAY TO THE<br />
STATION, PERUGIA.</p>
</div>

<p>At the turn of the path we came
into a delightful lane, between bramble-covered
banks; on one side was the dry
bed of a little rill, and overhead branches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
of quaint trees met each other. From
the Italian custom of constantly stripping
the leaves to provide fodder, the foliage
was scanty, yet we went down the steep
path in cool and checkered shadow;
lizards, darting across the way before us,
gleamed as they passed in and out of
the light.</p>

<p>This practice of stripping leaves from
the trees for fodder, gives a quaint
appearance to many of them; in this
lane the gnarled and twisted branches
looked grotesque. A man high up in
one of the trees sang as gaily as a bird,
while he filled with leaves a sack fastened
to one of the branches.</p>

<p>Now and again the rich transparent
purple of the shadows was traversed
by a bar of golden light; this sometimes
came in irregular flecks from spaces
between the twisted trunks and crossing
branches.</p>

<p>A woman coming up from the station,
with a heavy basket on her head, said,
"Buon Giorno," and smiled pleasantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
as she passed; then a countryman, a
fine, handsome fellow with glowing
black eyes, wished us a good journey.
He was going at such a pace that he
must have been bound for the station;
usually the easy, leisureful
movements of its
people seem to me one
of the charms of Italy,
so entirely in harmony
with the burning, palpitating
blue of its skies
and the careless luxuriance
of its vegetation.</p>

<p>Near the end of the
descent is a washing
place, and here a woman on her knees
was hard at work, scrubbing and soaping
linen. Looking back up the lane we
saw the grey town peeping at us through
the trees,&mdash;the tower of a house on the
Piazza a prominent feature in the view.</p>

<div class="fig_red p4"><a name="i_b_078fp" id="i_b_078fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_078fp.jpg" width="314" height="486" alt="" />
<p class="drop-cap p4">FONTANA BORGHESE<br />
  <i>outside PERUGIA</i></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">At the foot of the lane we crossed
the dusty highroad, and again followed
the short way, here very steep and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
rugged. At the end we came out at a
cross-road where the Fontana Borghese,
at one angle, made a striking feature;
partly shadowed by tall cypresses, it
glowed red in the sunshine. The date
is 1615; its basin is green with age,
and from the constant drip, drip of
the water. To-day the fountain was
surrounded with wine carts, each drawn
by a pair of huge white oxen. It is
fortunate these beautiful creatures are
so gentle, for their wide-spreading,
sharply pointed horns make them formidable;
indeed, when the wine season
began, during our stay in Perugia, we
had sometimes to take refuge in a shop while
they passed, for the horns of a
pair of these splendid beasts stretched
from one side of a narrow street to the
other. Inside a little wine-shop opposite
the Fontana Borghese we heard shouts
of "Dieci," "otto," "sette," etc., from
the players at morra.</p>

<p>One of the charms of Perugia is the
genial courtesy of the people. My companion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
on this excursion had stayed
several times in the town, and to-day
when she appeared at the station all
the officials were at her service, full of
little friendly attentions, especially one
giant-like porter called "Lungo."</p>

<p>The railway takes its course to Foligno
through the valley of the Tiber, with
mountain views on each side. Perugia
stands grandly on the top of her hills,
while on one side rises like an advanced
guard the spire of San Pietro, and on
a spur to the west Santa Giuliana;
but the city is not so picturesque from
this point, because one sees the modern
buildings on the great Piazza Vittor
Emanuele. On the left we saw the
outside of the famous Etruscan tomb
of the Volumnii, and soon after passed
the pretty village of Ponte San Giovanni,
getting a glimpse of the Tiber.</p>

<p>From the railway one has a good
view of Assisi, clinging to the side of
Monte Subasio, and the station is close
to the church of Santa Maria degli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
Angeli; but we were bound for Foligno,
and did not stop here to-day. As the
railway circles round it we noted the
splendid mass made by Subasio in this
chain of mountains.</p>

<p>We passed by Spello, perched on a
spur of the great hill, but it was disappointing
to find that, after this, the
valley broadened out into a plain, so that
Foligno stands tamely on level ground.
It does not seem to be much visited,
though it is a quaint little town, and
has, we heard, a tolerable inn.</p>

<p>On our arrival we were attacked by
vociferous drivers and guides, so we
took one of the dirty little carriages
and drove up an avenue past the huge
statue of Niccolo Alunno, a native of
Foligno, to the Piazza. We were hardly
out of our vehicle when up rushed a
wretched-looking man, his bare chest
showing red and hairy through the opening
of his dirty shirt, while a huge piece
of green oilskin covered his shoulders.
"Ecco, Ecco, it is not possible the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
Signorine can find their way," he
shouted. "I only can show them
Foligno."</p>

<p>As he continued to persecute us,
and our time was short, we submitted,
and followed his guidance.</p>

<p>The outside of the cathedral fronting
the Piazza is curious. Two monsters,
lions in red granite, guard the portal;
one of these creatures has an eagle in
its mouth. Above the doorway is a
curious sort of arcade; the door-heading
itself has been recently restored with
the emblems of the evangelists. There
is nothing to see inside this church.
Opposite it is a quaint old building,
and on the right is the Tribunale del
Commune.</p>

<p>We had to wait some time here while
the keys were fetched; we then followed
the custode up an old stone staircase
to an ante-chapel to see the frescoes
of Ottaviano Nelli. We went on into
the little chapel; here the frescoes have
been restored. They represent the life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
of the Blessed Virgin, from her birth
to her Assumption, and are full of
interest.</p>

<p>Coming out, we followed our ragged,
repulsive-looking guide down a street
close by, and saw the Palazzo Deli,
a handsome building, designed, it is
said, by Baccio d'Agnolo. There are
three other churches; in one of them,
San Niccolo, is a Nativity by Alunno;
the figure of San Joseph is very fine.
One of the statues in front of the
choir, a female saint, has her feet bound
with brass; the sacristan told us that
this had been done to preserve them
from the devotion of worshippers who
had already kissed away the ends of
the saint's toes. The frescoes in Santa
Maria infra Portas, a very old church,
are mostly ancient, but completely faded.
Raphael's beautiful Madonna di Foligno,
now in the Vatican, was once in the
church of Santa Anna in this town.</p>

<p>We greatly regretted that we could
not drive on to Montefalco, a picturesquely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
placed little town, with many
good pictures by Umbrian painters;
there are several also said to be by
Benozzo Gozzoli.</p>

<p>We took another little carriage, standing
in a side street, and had a very
pleasant drive back to Spello, between
vineyards and olive groves, eating our
luncheon on the way. Spello looked
very attractive as we approached it, its
white houses gleaming in the sunlight
against the green hill on the side of
which it stands.</p>

<p>We entered the town under a quaint
and ancient gateway, the Porta Veneris
of Hispellum, for Spello is an old Roman
town, and the ancient walls and some
of the gates have been preserved. This
gate has three figures outside it, a picturesque
fountain stands near, and to-day
beside it sat a group of handsome
peasants, eating and drinking in the
sunshine.</p>

<p class="caption">PORTA VENERIS, SPELLO.</p>
</div>

<p>We thought the steep old street was
full of pictures for a sketcher as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
drove up to the Piazza, on which is the
Cathedral Santa Maria Maggiore. Entering,
we were at once struck with the remarkable
early fifteenth-century canopy,
the work of an Umbrian sculptor, Rocca
di Vicenza; it is made of the stone of
the country called Cacciolfo, and has a
polished surface. The four pillars are in
pairs; in front of two of them the artist
has introduced portraits of himself and
his wife; beyond, right and left, are Madonnas
by Perugino. The sacristan told
us that there is a still finer specimen
of the sculptor Rocca di Vicenza's work
at Trevi. On the opposite side of the
church is the Capella del Sacramento,
the work of Pinturicchio; three of the
walls and the ceiling here are covered
with beautiful frescoes in delightful
harmony of colour. On one side is
the Annunciation, with the name and
portrait of the painter, on the other
walls are the Adoration and the Disputa;
this last is a very interesting
picture, and is also signed. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>
ceiling are painted the sibyls, and the
spaces between are filled with rich,
harmonious colour.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_088" id="i_b_088"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_088.jpg" width="178" height="228" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PINTURICCHIO, SPELLO.</p>
</div>

<p>We could gladly have stayed much
longer in this chapel, for the frescoes
seemed to us finer specimens of Pinturicchio's
work than anything we had
seen at Perugia. In the sacristy is
a beautiful Madonna by this painter.
The mortuary chapel has a quaint pair
of doors in perforated wood-work; near
the west door we saw a curious square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
bas-relief of ancient work, on two sides
of it is carved an olive-tree, and on
another side a man on horseback. It
looked like an old burial urn.</p>

<p>The way was so steep for driving,
that from the cathedral we walked on
in search of the woman who had the
keys of the church of San Andrea. She,
however, being busy, handed us over
to a young fellow with a face as lovely
as Raffaelle's, and with those wonderful
blue eyes, which have in them the glow
of an Italian sky, not to be seen in more
northern regions.</p>

<p>But at San Andrea, while we were
looking at the Pinturicchio behind the
high altar, a very courteous and intelligent
priest came into the church. Seeing
us, he kindly removed the cross which
obstructed our view of the best part of
the altar picture, the child San John the
Baptist, who sits writing on his scroll
at the feet of the Blessed Virgin. This
figure is supposed to be Raffaelle's work.
St. Francis and St. Lawrence are on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
one side, St. Andrew and St. Gregory
on the other; the embroidery on St.
Lawrence's vestments is wonderfully
painted, but as a whole this picture is
not nearly so good as the frescoes by
the same master in the cathedral.</p>

<p>The priest pointed out to us a graceful
arcade surrounding the front and ends
of an altar. This was discovered some
years ago, concealed beneath a much
larger altar which had been placed above
the chest containing the bones of San
Andrea; he told as that when the bones
were sought for, in order to remove them,
the arcade was brought to light. The
priest also showed us a fresco on the
wall of the nave, and graphically related
how he himself, only a few months before,
had discovered it under the whitewash
when the church was being cleaned for
a festa. Who knows how many treasures
still lie concealed on the church
walls of these out-of-the-way towns;
it must be owned, however, that the
newly found fresco at Spello is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
artistically a treasure, nor nearly as
interesting as was the story of its discovery
owing to its graphic telling.</p>

<p>From San Andrea our blue-eyed,
gentle-spoken young guide led us to the
top of the town, crowned by the deserted
Capuchin convent. "They have sent
all the brothers away," he said sadly;
"there is but one left, and he may not
live in the convent, he may only come
up in the afternoon, and see the schoolboys
play in the garden." There is a
pathetic look about the deserted, peaceful
old place. From the platform in
front of it we enjoyed a splendid view;
before us on one side was the ever-present
Subasio, towering over all, and on the
top of the hill behind stood Perugia,
looking at this distance like some giant
castle.</p>

<p>At our feet in the green valley was
the amphitheatre of Spello; not so
perfect as that at Fiesole, but with
clearly defined tiers of grassed seats
rising one above another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span></p>

<p>Porta Augusta is another interesting
gateway. We came slowly down the
steep street, getting constant peeps,
between tall, grey houses, of the blue
mountains around us. At one of these
breaks in the wall a group of peasants
sat, some spinning, some idling, beneath
a vine that stretched on a trellis from
house to house, the light filtering through
the leaves became a golden green before
it fell on the merry souls in the by-street
below. The men of Spello look fine,
robust fellows, and the women are very
tall and erect.</p>

<p>One handsome grey-haired dame met
us as we came down the ladder-like
street; she was spinning from a distaff
in her hand. "Dio," she held it out to
my companion, "che brutta lavoro!"</p>

<p>"Would that I could do it," was the
prompt answer, and the old dame went
off chuckling with delight.</p>

<img src="images/i_b_093.jpg" width="305" height="389" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PORTA AUGUSTA, SPELLO.</p>
</div>

<p>The little town is like an eyrie high up
in the air, the houses nestling here and
there for shelter behind the grey walls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span></p>

<p>We saw so many bits by the way in
Spello, that it seemed as if one might
spend some pleasant days in such an
exquisitely placed spot; but we could
not spy out any possible lodging; and,
after all, it is an easy distance by rail
or carriage from Assisi or Foligno.</p>

<p>Coming home by train to Perugia,
we travelled with a pleasant-looking
Italian lady and her sad-faced husband.
She also seemed sad, and constantly
put her handkerchief to her eyes; we
fancied she was affected by some deep
sorrow, and felt sympathy for her. The
train presently stopped at a station;
her distress increased, she clasped her
hands, and entreated her husband to
get out of the carriage and see after
the poor little "angiolo."</p>

<p>He gently refused, and at this she
sobbed, and almost howled with anguish;
then, burying her face in her handkerchief,
she leaned back and refused to be
comforted.</p>

<p>At the next station we heard the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
sharp yelping of a little dog, and then
she cried out so loudly for the "povera
bestia" that we began to understand.
Seeing we were interested, she sat
up, pocketed her handkerchief, and explained.
"The officials have taken my
dog from me, and have shut it up. Dio!
the sweet angel would not hurt a soul,"
she said, with a fresh flow of tears; "its
cries break my heart. It is a cruelty
beyond belief."</p>

<p>At this her husband left the carriage,
looking much ashamed of himself.
When he came back he tried to pacify
his still weeping wife.</p>

<p>"The dog is all right, cara mia," he
said.</p>

<p>"Cara mia," however, would not listen,
and she actually sobbed and cried all
the way to Perugia, where we left her
on the platform with her pocket-handkerchief
rolled into a ball, and pressed
close to her eyes.

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="s08">THE HEAVENLY CHOIR OF
PERUGIA</span></h2>

<p class="caption">POTS AT<br />
WINDOW.</p>
</div>

<p>We had greatly desired to see the
façade of the Oratory built
in honour of San Bernardino
of Siena, and we went in
search of it. Going past the
cloisters of the cathedral, we
traversed the street beyond them: on
one side is a fragment of an old palace,
on the other a quaint series of ancient
arches, one within the other, full of
striking effects of light and shade.</p>

<p>A street descends steeply from this
portal. We noted here, and in many of
the old house-fronts, carved brackets,
for holding flower-pots, built out from
the walls, their grey stone making a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
pleasant contrast to the brilliant red
and orange of the flowers blossoming
in pots placed within these hoary receptacles.
We sometimes saw metal rings
instead of stone brackets fastened into
the wall, so as to hold a flower-pot.</p>

<p>A wealthy Englishman, staying in
our hotel, became so enamoured of the
quaint effect created by these stone
brackets, that he told us he was resolved
to transport some of them to the front
wall of his newly-built London dwelling.
He went to the owner of a house possessing
several of the brackets, and offered
him a round sum for a couple of them.
The owner professed himself delighted
with the offer; he would most willingly
gratify the English Signor's fancy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_099" id="i_b_099"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="326" height="415" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIA SANT' AGATA.</p>
</div>

<p>"The Signore Inglese must, however,
understand," he said, with a twinkle
in his heavy-lidded dark eyes, "that
these articles are not individual,&mdash;they
are the same as the nose on the face,
fixtures. To possess the brackets, the
Signore Inglese must purchase the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
front of the Palazzo, it is built all in
one piece." This was too much for even
an English collector; he was obliged to
quit Perugia without acquiring even one
of the much-desired brackets.</p>

<p>As we went along, we saw, outside the
door of an old grey house, a pretty,
ragged, fair-haired child, jumping and
dancing on her little bare feet, chattering,
as it seemed, to the doorpost.
She was trying to reach the knocker,
and was talking merrily to the flies on
the wall, by way of amusement while
she waited.</p>

<p>Near the Church of S. Agata we
inquired for the house of Perugino, but
this Via de' Priori so winds and twists
that we were told we were too far north,
so we turned at a sharp angle, and
after a little came to a silent open space
in front of a church, the Chiesa Nuova.</p>

<p>Down an arched passage close by,
and up a side street on the right, we
reached Via Deliziosa; in this Perugino's
house is marked by a tablet. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
is nothing special in the appearance of
the dwelling; the hilly street in which it
stands is grass-grown, and weirdly silent.</p>

<p>We went back again to seek for San
Bernardino, and descended into a very
old quarter of the city, the projecting
claw which on this side overlooks the
deep valley below Porta Susanna, and
forms one point of the Cupa. We had
to pass by the last remaining fortress
of the nobles, the tall brick Torre degli
Scalzi; behind this are remains of the
Etruscan wall.</p>

<p>Close by we saw another church,
Madonna di Luce, a good example of
Renaissance work, gay with a scarlet and
gold curtain, in readiness for to-morrow's
festa; then, by a quaint little street with
flights of brick steps leading down into
most picturesque side-turnings, we came
in sight of a small house, its grey stone
balcony screened from the sunshine by
a vine-wreathed pergola.</p>

<p class="caption">MADONNA DI LUCE.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we reached the convent
of San Francesco, beside which is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
the matchless façade of the chapel or
oratory of San Bernardino of Siena.</p>

<img src="images/i_b_105.jpg" width="264" height="219" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FAÇADE OF SAN BERNARDINO.</p>
</div>

<p>The detail of this façade is even more
beautiful than we had expected; the
colour of its rosy marbles and terra-cotta
adds warmth to the exquisite
sculptures. These seemed to us finer,
both in design and execution, than any
Della Robbia work we had seen. We
were glad to find this opinion endorsed
by Mr. Perkins in his Tuscan Sculptors.
The façade is the work of Agostino
Ducci or Gucci, of Florence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_b_106.jpg" width="145" height="138" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ANGEL, SAN BERNARDINO.</p>
</div>

<p>A circular arch, almost as wide as the
façade, surmounts two square-headed
entrance doors; these are surrounded
by delicately carved ornament in low
relief. Above the door is a frieze, on
which are represented events in the
life of San Bernardino; over it, in the
centre of the tympanum, which is deeply
recessed within the arch, is a Vesica,
formed by tongues of flame containing
a figure of the saint, said to be the
best existing likeness of him. Four
flying angels placed diagonally on either
side of the Vesica seem to float as
they offer their musical sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving. Six of them
are playing various instruments; the expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
in each countenance is varied.
Some of the faces are very lovely, especially
the two praying with uplifted heads;
the others seem to be chanting hymns
of praise to the music of their respective
instruments. The disposition of the
angels' robes is perfect; its studied grace
reminded us of Lord Leighton's
drapery, the whole
effect being as artistic as it
is original.</p>

<p class="caption">HEADS OF CHERUBIM, SAN BERNARDINO.</p>
</div>

<p>Filling up the rest of the
tympanum, so as to make
a background to the angels,
there are the quaintest
heads of cherubs cradled in
lovely wings, carved in full
relief. Some of these heads
are missing, but those which remain are
exquisite studies of baby faces, each with
its own special expression, some roguish,
others sweet and loving; one of them
seems to suppress a sob. There is infinite
variety among them; and all are so very
human that they are doubtless transcripts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
from fifteenth-century Perugian
babies.</p>

<p class="caption">ANGELS, SAN
BERNARDINO.</p>
</div>

<p>Winged creatures are carved in the
spandrels of the arch; and slightly below
on either side is an angel within an
arched niche, over which is a pediment,
the mouldings and soffits showing delicately
sculptured ornament;
they are repeated below, and
there are still other angels of
the Heavenly Choir, playing
musical instruments; these
are on the broad pilasters
that support the arch; some
are in pairs, with very
beautiful faces. The arrangement
of their draperies is
especially remarkable.</p>

<p>In all these figures and faces, besides
the beauty of expression, there is a
marvellous mingling of quaintness and
grace; they are so life-like that one
almost listens for the sound of their
instruments, in meet accompaniment
to their chants, or to the hymns of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
the cherubs, who above and beside
them are singing a chorus of praise.
The Oratory is surmounted by a pediment,

find angels and cherubs. On the
fringe of the pediment are the carved

<p class="center s95">AUGUSTA PERUSIA MCCCCLXI.</p>

<p>The illustrations help the reader's
appreciation of this gem of Perugia;
mere words can only sketch, without
giving an adequate idea of its beauty.</p>

<p>The authorities of the city were eager
to show their appreciation of the wonderful
reformation effected in its morals
by the preaching of San Bernardino;
only a few years after his death, the
building of this beautiful memorial was
begun, and seems to have been completed
about 1462.</p>

<p>Bernardino's father was governor of
Massa; in the year 1380, when Saint
Catherine died in Siena, the future
preacher was born in the little town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
Early left an orphan, he was tenderly
reared by three aunts, all excellent
women. He, unlike his great prototype,
seems not to have shared the fashionable
vices of other youths of the period; he
was from an early age bent on following,
so far as he could, the example left him
two hundred years earlier by Saint
Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p>He spent some time in that convent
of Fiesole which educated Fra Angelico
and others, ardent to revive in their
generation the work of St. Francis,
which had suffered eclipse. Various
reasons have been given for this, chief
among them being the pagan tendency
of the Renaissance teaching, and also
the frequent visitations of plague, which
seem almost to have emptied the convents,
sweeping off the monks and nuns
who gave up their lives to tend the sick
in hospitals. In most of the Italian
states and cities the descendants of
devout Christians had become fierce
and brutal, as unrestrained in appetite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
as they were murderous and lawless in
deeds. Some of these have already been
narrated. Princes and nobles strove
to surpass the citizens in evil-doing
by the hideous tragedies they enacted.
This had been especially the case for
many years in Perugia, whose inhabitants
had come to be designated by the
epithet "ferocious": they were so given
up to every sort of crime.</p>

<p>Bernardino was deeply stirred by the
evil report that reached him from all
parts of the country; he had already
been received into the Minor Conventual
Order of San Francis, and had signalised
his courage by nursing and ministering
to the plague-stricken inmates of the
hospital in Siena. This had injured
his health, but he gladly obeyed the
commission given by his superior, to
journey through a certain part of Italy,
preaching as he went.</p>

<p>Already the evangelising movement
was in the air: in France, a Spaniard,
San Vincent Ferrier, had reaped a bountiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
harvest of souls. Bernardino determined
by God's help to evangelise his
country, and to rescue souls from evil
by the winning power of love. He
decided to begin his crusade in Umbria,
in the powerful city of Perugia, so
notorious for the crimes of its bloodstained
nobles and the frivolity and
vanity of their women.</p>

<p>Bernardino lodged in a convent outside
the city gate, and went every morning
to preach in the Piazza Pubblico.
Crowds had flocked to hear his first
sermon, but he had a consciousness that
this was mere excitement, and that the
souls of his listeners were yet to be won.
One day he told his congregation that
he proposed before long to show them
the Evil One. This announcement sent
the multitude crazy with excitement; the
throngs of his listeners were doubled.
But for some days after Bernardino
preached only in an ordinary fashion.</p>

<p>Still the people believed he would
keep faith with them, and each day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>
brought a larger crowd of expectant
listeners. At last, one morning, Bernardino
said, "I am now going to fulfil
my promise; I will show you not
one devil only, for there are several
here." Then, raising his voice, "Look
at one another, you will each see Satan
in your neighbour's face; every one of
you does that Evil One's bidding." He
then pointed out seriously, and with
much pathos, the sins that reigned among
them, and implored his hearers to
renounce their evil practices. The
effect of his words was wonder-striking.
Families who had lived in hatred of
their fellow-citizens for more than a
generation, hurried forward, and, clasping
the hands of their once-detested
foes, begged forgiveness for wrongs
committed; in more than one instance,
with halters round their necks, they
besought pardon for the evil they had
wrought. Bernardino saw that the
devotion of the city was roused, and,
turning to the women, he commanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>
them to cause two huge fires to be
lighted on the Piazza.</p>

<p>"Set a pattern to your men," he
exclaimed; "prove the reality of your
penitence; cast into the flames the
gauds by which Satan tempts you to
ensnare mankind to their ruin; bring
hither your cosmetics, your perfumes,
your false tresses, and the garlands with
which you deck them, your sumptuous
robes, all the vanities you possess, and
cast them into the flames."</p>

<p>Sobbing and weeping, the women
rushed off to obey him; they soon
returned laden with the vanities denounced
by the preacher, and, like the
Florentines many years later, they cast
their prized adornments into the huge
fires.</p>

<p>An old chronicler relates that one
noble dame cherished a long false tress
of singular beauty, which had always
commanded admiration; she felt that
this would prove a worthy offering.
Taking it from its casket, she was about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
to hurry with it to the Piazza; she again
looked at it.</p>

<p>No, she could not make the sacrifice,
the tress was too lustrous, too lovely;
more than all, it became her so rarely.
Her heart failed her. She put it back in
the casket, with a smile of contempt at
her own superstition; she was closing
the lid, when suddenly the beauteous
tress sprang up and struck her violently
on the cheekbone. She cried out with
pain and terror; then, forcing the
temptation into the casket and closing
the lid, she fled back to the Piazza,
and flung the treasured lock into the
flames.</p>

<p>For a while after this famous preaching,
peace and devotion returned to the
hill-city; then came sad outbreaks and
dissensions, and Bernardino, hearing the
disturbing news, returned to Perugia.
He exhorted his former penitents to
seek after the grace and the love which
had once been granted them, and at the
close of the year 1425 he once more left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
them in peace one with another; while
he went to preach elsewhere in Umbria,
and finally to Gubbio, to Viterbo, and
to Orvieto.</p>

<p>Two years later, when preaching in
Siena, he held up the conversion of the
people of Perugia as an example to be
followed by the Sienese.

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="s08">SAN PIETRO DE' CASINENSI</span></h2>

<p>The most remarkable church in
Perugia is the church, at the end of
the southern point of the city, attached
to the convent of San Pietro; below it
is the gate named after San Costanzo,
said to have been the first Bishop of
Perugia. On the opposite side of the
way from the convent wall is a pleasant
public resort, shaded by trees, called
Passeggiata Pubblica. From this point,
looking down the steep road, one gets a
delightful view of the near valley and
distant Apennines, framed in by the arch
of Porta Costanzo. This view goes by
the name of La Veduta. La Veduta and
a lovely country walk beyond the gate
are associated with the memory of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
accomplished artist and delightful companion,
Lord Leighton. He dearly loved
the old hill-city; in its delightful quiet
he used to write his lecture for the
Royal Academy students. One of his
favourite walks was to go out by the
Porta Costanzo, and along the lovely
lanes beyond it, grown over with honeysuckle,
wild gourd, and an abundance
of wild myrtle.</p>

<p>The ancient church of San Pietro, with
its very picturesque exterior and campanile,
serves as a conspicuous landmark
in the country over which it gazes.
It is said to be the oldest church in
Perugia, and to be built on the site of
an Etruscan temple; it was certainly
in old days the first cathedral. Built
by Pietro, a saintly abbot of the monastery
in the tenth century, it seems to
have remained for a long period almost
untouched; in the fourteenth century
the campanile was considered one of the
wonders of Italy. A century later it
was restored and decorated with rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
Renaissance work, some of which is very
fascinating and interesting. Then came
a warlike abbot, resolved to convert
the very salient tower of San Pietro into
a fortress to overawe the surrounding
country; and also to use it as a means
of defence against the ever-turbulent
people of Perugia, and the despots who
were always quarrelling among themselves
in order to attain supreme power
in the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_121" id="i_b_121"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_121.jpg" width="482" height="346" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LA VEDUTA, PERUGIA.</p>
</div>

<p>The campanile was still further injured
by Pope Boniface the Ninth, who also
wished to construct an ordinary fortress
on the site of the beautiful tower.
Finally, the monks rebuilt it at a great
cost. It was then struck by lightning,
and severely damaged. For a long period
of time the injuries caused by lightning
were so frequent that it was feared
the entire building would suffer ruin;
then at last the idea of a lightning conductor
suggested itself. This saved the
campanile, and it has since remained in
its present condition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span></p>

<p>We went up the steps in the convent
wall, and entered the old church of
San Pietro from the courtyard, by a
doorway with a deeply carved heading
in marble. The interior is at once rich
and fascinating, and every subsequent
visit we made to it revealed many
treasures.</p>

<p>Some of the Perugino pictures in
the sacristy are worth examination, but
the large altar-piece he painted for
this church was carried away to Paris
by Napoleon Bonaparte. The choir
books can be seen here, illuminated
by the monks of San Miniato, near
Florence. There are several pictures
in the church; in one of the aisles is a
painting by the early Umbrian master,
Benedetto Bonfigli. The ancient, dark
grey columns on either side of the
nave are much older than the church,
having been brought here from the
curious old church at Porta San Angelo,
near the most northern gate of Perugia.
We had already seen sixteen of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>
columns in the ancient round church;
they are supposed to date from a very
early period. The altar tomb of the
Baglioni, by Fieado, is in San Pietro;
but the most remarkable feature of
this church is its choir. The stalls and
their seats are full of exquisitely carved
wood-work, and the doors at the east
end are marvellous specimens of intarsia
work. The sacristan shows them with
great pride, and then opens the doors
which lead on to the balcony behind.</p>

<p>Below us we see a very lovely picture:
the fertile valley and its surroundings
of richly-tinted hills, while in front is
Assisi, clinging to the side of rugged
Monte Subasio. It is said that three
citizens of Perugia escaped by means
of this balcony from the Pope's Swiss
guards, when, less than fifty years ago,
the Swiss forcibly took possession of
the convent. The delicate work of
the eastern doors was executed by Fra
Damiano of Bergamo; it is singularly
beautiful; perhaps the finding of Moses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
in the bulrushes is one of the most
curious subjects depicted.</p>

<p>The choir seats and stalls were done
by Damiano's brother, Stefano da Bergamo.
They are worth a very careful
examination, for, besides the intarsia
on the backs and seats, and the fine
carving of the poppy-heads, notable
both for subject and execution, there
are, between each stall, wonderful and
beautifully-modelled creatures. Now we
see a beast like a crocodile, and next
it a harpy; then an elephant, a dolphin,
a sphinx, and so on; an infinite variety,
almost every creature is different, and
the carving of each is most artistic.</p>

<p>We saw many treasures in the church,
before we went out into the cypress-bordered
garden of the convent, and
again enjoyed the lovely view from the
top of its high wall,&mdash;the view which
wearied Popes and other great and
jaded personages have taken pleasure
in gazing at when they came to Perugia
for refreshment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span></p>

<p>An intelligent-looking priest showed
us the garden. He said it was kept in
order by the boys belonging to the
convent. This formerly sheltered a reformatory
for lads sentenced to prison
for their first offence. It is now, I
believe, used as an Agricultural College.
We had previously noticed the reformatory
boys at work on the olive fields
outside the town gates, and had admired
the picturesque effect of their blue
uniforms and straw hats against the
silver grey of the leafy background.</p>

<p>They had then come trooping into the
cloisters, and on close inspection they
did not look so interesting as we had
thought them; some of them, however,
had simple, honest faces, and as they
passed into the cloister they smiled and
raised their hats to the Fra. Most of
the bigger fellows had an ugly scowl,
and went in with bent heads, without
any greeting.</p>

<p>The Fra told us the lads behaved
fairly well; his trouble was to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
suitable employment for them when
they were discharged from the reformatory.
He said he greatly approved of
English laws, especially in regard to
the working class. "The English are
so good to foreigners," he said.</p>

<p>He asked us what would be the cost
in London of a working-man's board
and lodging. We told him that we had
in England already too many boys of
this sort, for whom it was difficult to
find employment; we, however, gave him
an average of the expenses he inquired
about. This seemed to alarm the good
Padre; with lifted hands he said, "Such
a plan would prove far too costly, it
would teach the lads expensive habits of
living." But he thanked us courteously
for our information. When we left the
convent garden we stood again enjoying
the view over the lovely valley, under
a glorious sunset which glowed on the
distant hills. It seemed to us that
splendid sunsets were another and special
charm of Perugia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span></p>

<p>We had meant this evening to visit
the Etruscan sepulchres of the Volumnii,
discovered only about sixty years ago,
and within a walk of the San Costanzo
gate; but San Pietro, even in this short
visit, had proved such an interesting
study, that we saw we must defer our
walk to the ancient tomb.</p>

<p>We were, however, told that, without
much adding to the length of our walk,
we should considerably increase its charm,
if, instead of passing out by the Porta
Costanzo, we turned aside by the Porta
San Pietro, or Romana, as it is called,
and quitted the city by the little gate
at the bottom of the descent. This
is indeed a delightful walk under the
old grey walls, and from it one has a
perfect view over the lovely country
and the purple hills.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="s08">THE TOMBS OF THE VOLUMNII</span></h2>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_130" id="i_b_130"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_130.jpg" width="138" height="142" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GIRL'S HEAD.</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later, as we went
along a lane, with grassy
flower-pied banks, and
with purple hills as background
to the sunlit glory
which surrounded us, we
recognised the delightful landscape so frequently
used by Perugino. The way was
rather long, but there was more in it
to interest than to tire us. We at last
arrived at the dark descent beside the
road, which forms the entrance to the
sepulchre of the Volumnii. Many years
ago there was supposed to be a necropolis
existing in this hill, and on excavation
several small cells were discovered.
In more recent years an ox was seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
suddenly to stumble on the hill above,
and to be unable to rise. Going to help
it, beneath the hole into which the
creature had thrust its foot a subterranean
arch was revealed, and subsequent
excavation brought to light the wonderful,
long-closed tombs of the Etruscan
Volumnii.</p>

<p>We went down some rugged steps to
the mouth of the gloomy cavern, and
found ourselves in a dark passage-way,
with stone benches on either side. The
weird, mysterious atmosphere of the
Etruscan vault is indescribable. Several
chambers or cells, in this underground
house of the departed, branch out on
either side of the dark vaulted passage,
but we saw them in such semi-darkness,
that by the light of a single torch it
was very difficult to make out details.
As we went along the dark vault, our
guide raised his torch on high. In a
moment we seemed to be in an enchanted
cavern, where the silent inhabitants were
guarded by strange forms; gorgon heads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
owls, and serpents stared at us from
roof and walls. We could fancy that, as
we passed by, the snake heads seemed
to dart from the walls, to bristle and
hiss; and the grand Medusa-faces overhead
looked down on us full of dire
warning, when at the end of the passage
we entered the tomb of the Etruscan
family. Here are the Volumnii sitting
in a group, realistic terra-cotta figures
guarding their urns, just as they have
been guarding them for perhaps two
thousand years.</p>

<p>Aruns Volumni, the father, reclines
on his sarcophagus, which is guarded
by two furies; on his left his daughter
sits on her urn, and on his right is his
son. Their faces look dull and uninteresting,
but they seem aware of their
own importance. The fourth figure of
the group, seated next the son of
Aruns, is Veilia, his fair young wife.
She has an exquisite face, and one is not
surprised to learn that she died young;
she must have felt isolated among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
such unsympathetic family surroundings.
Her face and those of the majestic
solemn-eyed Medusas are the most interesting
treasures of the tomb. All the
faces and figures of the Volumnii are
intensely life-like; Aruns himself has
a purse-proud expression.</p>

<p>Coming out into welcome fresh air
and daylight, we saw that the entrance
to the tomb was fringed by a profusion
of maidenhair fern, growing between the
blocks of travertine. A weird-faced
child, with dark eyes shining through a
tangle of dusky hair, showed a brilliant
gleam of white teeth as she offered us
tufts of this fern ruthlessly torn out
by its roots. She seemed the uncanny
guardian of the place.</p>

<p class="p2">Another walk with an outlook less
splendid than that of the Veduta and
others, yet with a special charm of its
own, was a great favourite with us. To
reach it one has to go past the interesting
old church of San Ercolano, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
turning up beside it, till some iron
gates are arrived at; outside these, the
way was blocked on the right, so we
turned leftwards, and followed the course
of the picturesque old wall; ancient
houses rise above it, and the wall itself
is crowned with flowers in pots and
stone vases. Here and there we saw
vine-wreathed loggias; then, at the far
end of a sudden turn, there came into
view Monte Luce, with its old church
and convent, and grand blue hills rising
beyond. I believe the church is really
called Santa Maria Assunta; it is the
bourne of a yearly pilgrimage at the
time of the great cattle fair, which
takes place on the green down across
the road.</p>

<p>We passed through the open convent
gate into a quaint and peaceful scene,
a small grassed quadrangle closed
in by a wall and the sacristan's
house; facing us was the west front
of the church, with a large window
under its low gable. The church wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>
itself is checkered with squares of red
and white stone. The two green doors,
under a double arch, were almost as
vivid in colour as the lizards basking
between the stones. On the right was
a low and singularly massive campanile;
its huge blue and white clock-face giving
a peculiar quaintness to the place. There
is a projecting side chapel below, with
slit-like windows; beyond this is a
cloister walk, its low tiled roof supported
by solid white-washed piers. This cloister
goes on to the angle where the convent
buildings adjoin the church, and extends
from this angle along the southern and
eastern sides of the little green square
to the entrance gates; on one side is
an upper storey, reached by a flight of
bricked steps.</p>

<p>A woman, sad and quiet-looking, but
with a sweet expression on her olive-hued
face, showed us the church, and
the little choir of the Sisters behind
the high altar. She told us how the
nuns from the suppressed and desecrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
convent of Santa Giuliana "had been
driven to take refuge in this blessed
house of Santa Maria Assunta." She
added with a deep sigh, "Who knows
what will happen next?"</p>

<p>It seemed sad that such a peaceful
home as this should be threatened.</p>

<p>A few steps beyond this church brought
us to a low wall; here we sat and
enjoyed the distant view framed in by
tall trees. It differs from any other
point in Perugia, in having a more
varied foreground. This is broken up
by green hills, with bright-looking
country houses nestling among gardens
and orchards, and surrounded by dark
trees; behind are the ever-beautiful
Apennines; between, in mid distance, is
that mingling of colour created by the
luxuriant vegetation of this fertile valley.
It was varied on this evening by cloud-shadows
cast on its mellowed sunny
glow.</p>

<p>While we sit enjoying all this beauty,
the Angelus sounds in sweet harmony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
with the scene; three, four, five, then
one long drawn-out solemn note.</p>

<p>From the frequent campaniles the
bells call one to another, and give deep-toned
musical response across the green
hollows that vandyke themselves up
the walled hillside into the town; the
brilliant sunset showing in bold relief
the salient balconies of a Palazzo not
far away.</p>

<p>We came back into the city by another
gate, and lost our way. Finally, however,
we turned up a very steep street,
and then down flights of steps by the
church of San Fiorenzo. There is
here a curious old wall with a garden
above it; a workman told us it was
the curate's garden.</p>

<p>In the lingering gleams of sunlight,
oleander blossoms overhead were glowing
masses of colour against the grey
stone wall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="s08">THE VIA APPIA</span></h2>

<p>The Oratory of San Bernardino is
near to gardens, orchards, and
drying grounds. Beyond the convent
of San Francesco the ancient wall goes
northward, and then turns east towards
the Porta Augusta, but this afternoon
we went southwards.</p>

<p>A short walk down a steep narrow
street beneath an archway led us
out of the low-browed passage of
the Etruscan Porta Susanna on to the
wall itself. This rises up directly from
La Cupa, as the indentation which
the valley here makes is called. The
wall follows the curves of the hills,
always keeping close to the edge of the
descent, and, as I have already said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
where an angle is sharply turned a
bold round tower stands out sentinel-wise
against the blue sky.</p>

<div class="fig_red p4"><a name="i_b_138fp" id="i_b_138fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_138fp.jpg" width="313" height="428" alt="" />
<p class="drop-cap p4">PORTA SUSANNA</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Below the wall the fertile dell was
literally covered with vines, olives, fig
and mulberry trees; plots of blue-green
cabbage and shining lettuce covered
bare spaces of brown earth. In winter
a torrent flows through the Cupa.</p>

<p>To-day the long range of hill on the
left looked red-brown, variegated with
green and grey; behind its shoulder
a more distant mountain showed opal;
tall regular houses of the ancient city
rose one behind another on the right,
and the last brick tower, that of the
Scalzi, rose above them all.</p>

<p>The wall makes here an inward angle
before it goes out far away westward
to another point of the star-shaped hill,
and here the view becomes more beautiful.
The outlines of the mountains cross,
and reveal through the openings yet
another ridge behind, and this farther
ridge looks a delicate opal, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
sunbeams become less powerful. On the
right the hills stretched in two purple
undulating lines, between them a rosy
vapour moved slowly, deepening in tint
as it rose towards the orange-coloured
clouds. Masses of grey now sent
up warnings from below, and partly
obscured the rosy vapour; southward
the grey took a lurid tinge, and across
it floated pale phantom-like cloudlets.
The far-off hill, as we looked southward,
had become a purple-blue, while the
town in the space between climbed
upwards in terraces, the houses bowered
in vines and garden blossoms.</p>

<p>This is not so extended a prospect
as some others that are to be had
from the walls of Perugia, but I am
inclined to consider it one of the most
interesting, from the double view it
offers of the town and of the quaint
formation of the steep-sided, triangular
valley, with its mysterious depth of
vegetation below.</p>

<p>We kept along the wall for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
distance, then our road led us away
from it between old stone garden walls,
supports for vines and figs, and brilliant
orange begonia blossoms which peep
above them. Quaint side-streets looked
tempting on our left. Going up one
of these, we found a portion of
Etruscan wall with an opening in it of
the same period of stone-work.</p>

<p>The street beyond mounted steeply
to where a brick arch spanned it: on
one side a flight of broken steps led up
to a tall house above the wall; a loggia,
corbelled out from between the house
and the grey pointed arch, was filled
with charming foliage and flowers; an
iron crane projected from the balcony
over a brick water-tank beside the broken
steps. The variety of form and colour
was most vivid against the shadow
within the arch; its two projecting imposts
were massive slabs of travertine,
and beside one of these, gleaming out
of the shadow, was a little shrine with
a nosegay of freshly-gathered flowers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span></p>

<p>In and out of narrow streets, up and
down quaint steps, we reached at last
the Ivory Gate, the Etruscan Porta
Eburnea,&mdash;that very quaintly-placed
old gate, from which a steep road goes
down into the country.</p>

<p>We had here an extended view of the
wall, curving grandly forward to a projecting
point, and completely obscuring
all view of La Cupa; the point itself
crowned by a most picturesque round
tower, standing out vividly from its
background of purple hills.</p>

<div class="fig_red p4"><a name="i_b_142fp" id="i_b_142fp"></a>

<p class="drop-cap p4">PORTA EBURNEA</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">The road from Porta Eburnea looked
attractive. On this special day it was
thronged with peasants going home
from market. Some of the women
stopped outside the gate; taking off
their boots, they slung them over their
shoulders, or put them in their baskets;
then, with brown bare feet and legs,
they went down the steep dusty road
with rapid, swinging steps. Most of
these bare-footed women wore handsome
coral necklaces; and yet shopkeepers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
asked from eighty to three hundred
francs for a string of these beads. Just
outside the gate a man and several boys
were playing some game with walnuts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_143" id="i_b_143"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_143.jpg" width="287" height="204" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OUTSIDE PERUGIA.</p>
</div>

<p>Coming home one evening from the
twisting way behind the cathedral, we
reached a lofty arched opening with
"Via Appia" printed on one side. The
arch itself has a house above it; a
second arch within, with grey projecting
imposts, shows a broad steep descent,&mdash;a
long flight of shallow brick steps,
so undecided as to the course they shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
take that they curve first one way and
then another, before they reach the
bottom of the descent.</p>

<p>Some way down, a viaduct supported
by three broad arches comes out beside
the stone-edged brick steps, while transversely
right and left are stone walls;
that on the right is high and massive,
and from its grey-green stones were
hanging long garlands of white-blossomed
caper plant.</p>

<p>Beyond, just before the wall joins
some old stone houses, we saw a little
pergola covered with the tender green
of the vine. From the deep hollow
into which the steps descend the town
rises up in front, and as we go down,
the old houses on our left, with gardens
and orchards, stand at a great height
above us, looking black against the
glowing sky.</p>

<p>From this viaduct is an extended view
over many curious roofs covered with
semicircular tiles, frosted with gold and
silver lichens and patches of green moss.

First comes a series of gardens, green
with vines and fig-trees; beyond these,
among the grey houses and trees, appears
the great modern building of the University.
Beyond it is the silk factory
of Count Faina; behind all are the
purple hills.</p>

<p>Instead of crossing the viaduct we
went down to the bottom of the
seemingly interminable brick staircase,
catching sight through the viaduct
arches on the left of a succession of
pictures: cottages backed by trees with
children in front at play, all in a vivid
effect of light and shade, framed in by
the low, broad arches.</p>

<p>This brought us finally on to a road
leading back into the town, spanned
on the left by another broad arch of
the viaduct. Through this a group of
feathered acacias glowed golden-green
in the sunshine against picturesque
houses backed by the hills.</p>

<p>The pointed arch on the right looks
quaint, from the contrast of its huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
grey stones and small many-shaped
windows, mostly open; some of them
gay with scarlet flowers; one window
had a faded green curtain, drawn half
across; a bird-cage hung outside it.
Behind the curtain the olive-hued face
of a woman peeped out.</p>

<p>Through the arch was a strong effect
of golden light and blue-purple shadow;
while we looked behind, there came a
donkey, driven by a merry-eyed, bare-footed
lad, dragging a cart heaped with
brushwood. A little way on along the
road is the mosaic pavement discovered
several years ago in some Roman baths.
The pavement is in singularly good
preservation, and the design is very
remarkable. Orpheus, a colossal black
figure on a white ground, sits with outstretched
arm, while a lion, a tiger,
an elephant, a hippopotamus, stags,
a rhinoceros, a horse, birds of various
kinds, a snail, a monkey, a tortoise,
and other creatures are drawn towards
him from all sides.

<p class="caption">ARCO DELLA CONCA, PERUGIA.</p>
</div>

<p>A handsome dark-eyed girl kept on
sweeping dust from the mosaic, and was
eager to point out that the brick-work
on one side has not been examined,
and probably hides a good deal more
of the pavement, as yet unexcavated.
The girl was so bright and good
to look at, that she seemed quite a
part of the show. Turning through
the arch, we very soon reached Piazza
Grimani, which has on one side the
Palazzo Antinori. Close by is the wonder
of Perugia&mdash;the Etruscan gateway, or,
as it is called from the inscription set
over it by the Romans when they took
the city, the Porta Augusta. It was
growing dusk, and the effect of this
grand mass of stone-work was stupendous.
On each side of the arched gateway
are massive towers,&mdash;the upper part
of the structure is less ancient than
the towers are; one of them is surmounted
by a loggia. Some of the
blocks of stone in the Etruscan part
of the wall are enormous, many of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>
four feet long, and within the gloom
of the arch is the wall, built on the
same gigantic scale.</p>

<p>As we went home through the narrow,
dark Via Vecchia, we saw a very quaint
scene. In a long, dark room, dimly
lighted by two oil-lamps hanging from
the ceiling, a man and woman were
selling soup and cold meat at a sort of
counter. The brown characteristic faces
and shining eyes of their ragged customers
told out wonderfully as occasional
gleams from the lamps above singled
them from the semi-darkness. In this
street we saw many examples of the
walled-up doors by which the dead
had been formerly carried out, closed
up, so that the living might never pass
by the same way.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_153" id="i_b_153"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_153.jpg" width="307" height="440" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PORTA AUGUSTA, PERUGIA.</p>
</div>

<p>Our next view of Porta Augusta
was by daylight. We had been told
by some one staying in Perugia where
to seek a special point of view from
the old walls near this arch. The Porta
Augusta is even finer in full light, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
reveals the immense strength of its construction.
When one considers that
these great blocks of stone must have
been brought from a long distance,
it is sad to think of the poor slaves
whose labour brought them and set
them in their places for their Etruscan
masters. Near here must have been the
house of that chief citizen who, seeing
the Romans, headed by Octavius Cæsar,
masters of his native city, and that there
was no longer a hope of freedom from
the detested yoke, set fire to his dwelling,
and burned himself and his whole family
therein, heedless that the blaze spreading
in all directions destroyed the chief part
of Etruscan Perugia.</p>

<p>Instead of following the Via Lungari,
or Garibaldi, on this occasion, our instructions
sent us down a narrow street in
a parallel direction, until we were stopped
by the inward curve of the city wall.
Just before we reached this, our way
was blocked by two wine carts laden
with barrels of new-made wine, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
drawn by a pair of huge cream-coloured
oxen, with soft dark eyes and long
horns reaching from one side of the
street to the other. I delight in these
splendid creatures; they look so gentle,
and though so huge they seem unconscious
of their power. They moved on
at last, and permitted
us to reach our
bourne.</p>

<p>The Porta Buligaia
was certainly the
most beautiful point
we had yet seen,
and we felt very
grateful to the great
artist who, knowing
every street of Perugia,
had so kindly told us how to take
this walk; for the little narrow street
opposite the Porta Augusta had hitherto
escaped our notice, although we had
spent so many weeks in Perugia.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_156" id="i_b_156"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_156.jpg" width="135" height="181" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PORTA BULIGAIA.</p>
</div>

<p>Just before the old wall reaches the
Porta it curves into a trefoil, and goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
down steeply to the fertile valley.
Through the open, green doors of the
gate the road winds beside the grand
wall, which, covered with greenery,
strikes forward to the north, tall grass
atop waving like pennons among the
trees above it.</p>

<p>The inner wall sends out a long flank
to reach the gate, and above, level with
its top, is a vine-covered pergola with
quaint gabled houses behind it; these
command a grand view over the hills
which circle round in shades of exquisite
blue, fading at last to opal. Plots of
maize glow through a grey mist of
olives; the vines, swinging from tree to
tree, are golden-green. As the road goes
down beside the wall beyond the gate,
it passes a white-walled cottage nestled
in trees. The view tempted us along
this road, and soon a path, bordered
by a black handrail, mounted on the
left beside a caper-wreathed wall of
stones: following it, we crossed a sort
of farmyard, where an enormous gourd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
vine lay atop a brick wall; huge pumpkins
were sunning themselves among
enormous leaves.</p>

<p>Beyond this, towards Perugia, the
land was richly cultivated; maize and
vegetables, fruit-trees and vines, covered
every scrap of ground. Here and there
a tangled bit of hedge served to prop
the luxuriant vines; there was no primness
anywhere, and yet the ground
seemed well cultivated.</p>

<p>Going on, the way curved, and the
view became still more extended; at
last we found ourselves in the road
again, and went on till we reached the
extreme northern point of Perugia&mdash;Porta
San Angelo.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_159" id="i_b_159"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_159.jpg" width="392" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PORTA SAN ANGELO.</p>
</div>

<p>Some little way outside is the convent
of San Francesco, and just within the
gate, from which, up a side path, there
is another delightful view, we came to
the round church of San Angelo, or
San Michele. This is very ancient,
and is said to have been formerly a
pagan temple dedicated to Vesta.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
The lower part is round, the upper
eight-sided, but the interior is circular.
The upper portion is supported by a
circle of sixteen dark-grey columns;
anciently there were three circles of
these columns. All but one of the two
outer circles have been taken away to
other parts of Perugia: we had already
seen some in San Pietro, and there are
two in one of the palaces on the market-place;
one still remains in the second
circle at San Angelo. This interior is
very interesting. In it is a well-preserved
sacrificial altar, and the woman who
guided us explained with much unction
how the victims were formerly sacrificed.
She also showed us some horrible instruments
of torture, and another altar,
said to be Roman. There is a curious
bas-relief on the wall near the sacristy.
We had already seen this church on a
festa, when, the altar blazing with
candles, the gaily-dressed people kneeling
in front of it and between the
surrounding circle of pillars, had a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
picturesque effect,&mdash;marred, it is true,
by the presence of sundry dogs among
the worshippers, and the extremely
cracked and untuneful sounds proceeding
from the music gallery. Our brown-faced,
withered guide was full of talk;
when we got into the sacristy, she
confided to me she had been foolish
enough to marry late in life; then, her
man had managed so badly that he
died and left her to take care of herself.
"Ah, yes," she said, "and there is more
than myself, there is a boy, and he is
nine years old; he eats well,&mdash;the Signora
knows how a boy eats at nine? Dio!
he is voracious; then he must be taught,
and school costs money, much money!
and yet, Dio! what a thing it is to
have schooling! I can neither read nor
write, and can earn but little; I wish
my son to do better than I, and yet,
Signora, I am not sure if it is wise."
Her keen black eyes twinkled at me.</p>

<p>I suggested that she must be right in
giving her son some schooling. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
sighed heavily, and darted another keen
glance at me out of her hungry dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Signora is right; but if I
spend money in teaching my son I can
have none for myself. Dio! what can
become of me when these"&mdash;she stretched
out her brown, capable-looking hands&mdash;"can
no longer work for me? Holy
Virgin! I know not." She gave another
heavy sigh, and again she looked wistfully
at me.</p>

<p>I said that if she did her duty by her
son he would be sure to take care of her
hereafter, but at this her face showed
me that we took different views. She
shook her head.</p>

<p>"It ought to be so, Signora," she said,
"but it is not; Dio, I have lived in the
world many years, and I have not found
that men are what they ought to be.
No! not one.&mdash;Pardon me, Signore,"
she looked deprecatingly towards my
companion. "The Signora has as much
money as she wants, and she does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
hear the truth; she sees the best side of
people, they show the worst to us poor
ones."</p>

<p>Poor woman! I hastened to assure
her that I was not in the happy state
she fancied. I felt ashamed at giving
her my modest fee, and said I wished
it could have been larger; but evidently
she was not greedy, she clasped both
her brown hands round my arm and
squeezed it, while she poured forth
effusive thanks. Then she went back
to the heap of stones near the entrance
of the cave where I had found her, sitting
like a hungry spider in wait for an
inquiring fly, in the shape of a traveller.

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="s08">THE WAY TO ASSISI</span></h2>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_165" id="i_b_165"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_165.jpg" width="129" height="163" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GIOTTO.</p>
</div>

<p>We had for years desired to
make a pilgrimage to Assisi,
and now, across the lovely
valley the sight of the little
white town clinging to
Monte Subasio, veiled by
grey and purple vapour, was a daily
reminder of our wish. Some places
stamp themselves into the heart, and
while life lasts the longing to revisit
them increases, till realisation quenches
desire. A visit to such a haunt of
delightful memories as Assisi requires
time, so we waited till a few days could
be spared.</p>

<p>It was very early morning when we
drove down from Perugia along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
Assisi road, a road bordered by the
silver and gold of olive-groves and vineyards.
Fragrant, dewy freshness lay on
everything; even when the sun rose
higher, and blazed fiercely down on
us, we had become so absorbed by the
surrounding scenery and its associations
that we did not seem to feel the brilliant
heat.</p>

<p>Now and then, between the leafy trees
on our right, we had glimpses of yellow
Tiber on its way to Rome. Francis
Bernardone must also have enjoyed these
glimpses as he walked to and from
Assisi with some favourite disciple, perhaps
along this very road.</p>

<p>St. Francis did a far greater work
for his contemporaries than any reformer
of the later Renaissance period. He did
not attack popes and bishops, or find
fault with everything and everybody
who differed from his special ideas:
he used the most powerful means by
which to influence mankind,&mdash;he lived
the life he preached. He had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
accustomed to luxury and every form
of self-pleasing,&mdash;he gave up all to follow
the way of the Cross, from love to his
Saviour. In that brutal and licentious
age, the beginning of the thirteenth
century, his example seems to have
been irresistible. The life of poverty,
obedience, and chastity enjoined by
his rule sounded utter folly when first
proclaimed to the multitude; but it
says something in favour of those times
that, when the first outcry ceased, and
his fellow-citizens witnessed the harmony
that existed between his life and his
teaching, he was left comparatively unmolested,
and his work was not materially
interfered with. Though he died
at forty-four, he lived long enough to
see his Order recognised by Holy Church
and by secular potentates, and to know
that its widely spread communities were
firmly established wherever they had
planted themselves.</p>

<p>It may be said of St. Bernard and
St. Dominick, that they also practised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
all they preached, but one feature
peculiar to St. Francis is not chronicled
of those other revivalists,&mdash;his idea of
life was a very happy one. In the
century that followed, Boccaccio did
not teach joy as a duty one whit more
strenuously than the Poverello did,
although the two men's ideas of the
source of joy were so opposite.</p>

<p>One remembers the recorded talk
about joy, of that which fails to make,
and of that which <i>is</i> the true root of
happiness, between Francis and Fra
Leone,&mdash;a talk which continued for
two miles, while the master and his
disciple walked out from Perugia to
Assisi.</p>

<p>At last Fra Leo, called by Francis
"the little sheep of God," cried out:
"Father, tell me, I pray thee, wherein
can perfect happiness be found?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Francis made his well-known
answer, recorded in the eighth
chapter of <i>I Fioretti</i> ("The Little Flowers
of St. Francis").
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span></p>

<p>As we drove along we remembered
that the hills looking down on us, now
varied by exquisite cloud-shadows, had
listened to cheerful lays, improvised in
the Provençal tongue by Francis as
he trudged along this road. He did not
have his hymns rendered into Italian
verse, so that they might be understood
by the people, until he needed them
to help his teachings; his sympathy
with human nature taught him the
power of music in creating fervent
devotion.</p>

<p>Reading the <i>Fioretti</i>, one learns that,
in spite of the severe rule he followed,
Francis enjoyed his life; there must
have been a singular power of fascination
in the man, who could always, wherever
he went, change sorrow into joy. He
rejoiced in the beauty of nature, and
went singing along the dusty way, between
the olive-trees and the grape-laden
vines, which then, as now, probably
bordered the road on either hand; he
rejoiced in every trial laid on him, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>
a fresh offering he could make to his
God.</p>

<p>Francis sang till the birds came fluttering
round him to share his gladness,
mingling their songs with his. At
Bevagna, a place south of Spello, he
preached his famous sermon to these
winged disciples, and bade the swallows
cease their disturbing twitter.</p>

<p>He loved all dumb creatures, and
strove to care for them, calling them
his brothers and sisters; at Gubbio he
tamed a wolf, till then the terror of
the place. Once, meeting a peasant
who had an armful of wild turtle-doves,
he took them from the man, lest they
should be killed or ill-treated, and,
bringing them home to La Portioncula,
he caused little nests to be made for
the gentle birds, bade them live peacefully,
and increase and multiply according
to the will of God.</p>

<p>As we drove along the lovely valley,
filled now with golden light varied by
purple shadow, its glorious background
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
of hills in every delicate shade of blue,
with spaces between, an opal gauze in
the sunshine, and villages nestling beside
the tree-shaded Tiber, we saw, hard
by, the grey-peaked bridge, so ancient
looking, that Francis may one time or
another have gone singing across it; and
we felt that such a mind could not have
lived amid so much beauty without
becoming interpenetrated by it.</p>

<p>He is so entirely incorporated with
Assisi and its surroundings, that one
cannot describe the old town without
now and again referring to the timeworn
tale, so beautifully told by Monsieur
Paul Sabatier.</p>

<p>Our two hours' drive between vines
and olive-trees backed by grand purple
hills had been lovely. The grapes were
almost ripe, pale gold in colour, thickly
hanging from tender green garlands,
which stretched from one tree to another
and linked them together. In some
fields long-horned oxen were ploughing
the stiff lumpy land between the vines;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>
here and there golden stalks of maize
lay on the rich brown soil. The sun-touched
summits of Subasio and his
brethren looked like radiant clouds; the
pure invigorating air was delightful.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_172" id="i_b_172"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_172.jpg" width="317" height="155" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CONVENT AND CHURCH OF SAN FRANCESCO.</p>
</div>

<p>As one nears Assisi, the two salient
points in the view are, on the left, high
up the mountain side, the great convent
of San Francesco, with its double
churches; on the right, at the foot of the
ascent to the town, is seen the dome of
Santa Maria degli Angeli.</p>

<p>The body of this church was built in
the sixteenth century over the original
chapel, the Portioncula, in which St.
Francis and his disciples worshipped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
and in which Santa Chiara and so many
others took the vows of the Order, and
devoted themselves to lead lives of
poverty, chastity, and obedience.</p>

<p>Huge Subasio had been in front of us
all the way, but we could now distinguish
clearly the long stretch of white houses
clinging midway to the side of the
mountain; and above the houses, the
campaniles and spires of Assisi, while
towering high over the road, supported
by a double row of lofty arches, are
the convent, and the two churches of
San Francesco.</p>

<p>In a picture it would be difficult to
give an adequate idea of the approach
to Assisi,&mdash;certainly word-painting cannot
describe it. Probably the thrill
caused by the associations and surroundings
of the town intensifies the
charm.</p>

<p>The varied colour of the hills on
either side of us had become more
exquisite. Now we had in full view
the scene described by Dante as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
birthplace of San Francesco, for the
town seems a part of the</p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold</p>
<p>Are wafted through Perugia's eastern gate,</p>
<p>Upon that side where it doth break its steepness most, arose</p>
<p>A sun upon the world"&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">Cary's Translation of <i>Il Paradiso</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For miles round, this building of San
Francesco makes a striking landmark,
and as long as it stands it bears witness
to the strange and beautiful story of
the youth who gave up all that seemed
to make life worth living, to save not
only his own soul, but those of others.</p>

<p>There was no tardy justice in the
recognition given to his holy life, and
the benefits worked by his discipline.
In 1228, two years after his death,
Francesco Bernardone was canonised by
Pope Gregory <span class="smcap">IX.</span>&mdash;the tried friend
who knew the life as well as the work
of El Poverello&mdash;as St. Francis of Assisi
was called, and the building of the Lower
Church was begun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span></p>

<p>Before the century ended this church
and the upper one had become a great
centre of art-workers; in a sense, we
may look on Francis of Assisi as a source
of inspiration to both Giotto and Dante;
they were all three originators and
purifiers.</p>

<p>Dante's description in the <i>Paradiso</i>,
or rather the story which he makes St.
Thomas Aquinas relate concerning Saint
Francis, shows that a lapse of centuries
has not in any way altered the
high esteem in which he was held less
than a century after his death. Dante
was born only thirty-nine years later;
and as he certainly visited Assisi, he
must have been well acquainted with
all the details of the saint's history.
It may have been in his exultation
at the triumphs achieved by his friend
Giotto's frescoes at Assisi that the
poet writes, after mentioning Cimabue,
"And now the cry is Giotto's."</p>

<p>Our driver stopped at the foot of
the hill, and told us we had better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
begin our pilgrimage at the church of
Santa Maria degli Angeli. We had,
however, planned to begin the wonderful
story at its first chapter, and to visit
the saint's birthplace, also the scene
of his final renunciation of the world.
So we bade honest Checco drive us
on to the Hotel Subasio beside the hill,
where we dismissed our carriage, and
looked at the room allotted to us.</p>

<p>We then climbed the bit of ascent,
and feasted our eyes on the outside
of the churches of San Francesco.</p>

<p class="caption">STATUE OF<br />
ST. FRANCIS.</p>
</div>
<p>As we mounted the hill the
great shrine had seemed
to rise higher and higher
above us; in the flaming
sunshine the olives
looked a pale silver
against the deep blue
sky. When at last we
took the way to the
monastery, we seemed
to have reached a deserted town. Assisi
was still and lifeless; the very inn was
asleep. Flies and gnats, however, made
us sharply feel that the heat gave
them extra thirst, and that we were a
boon in this absence of human life.</p>

<p>We had been told that the Lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
Church of the monastery is best seen in
morning light, so, instead of beginning
our pilgrimage with the first chapter
of the saint's story, in Chiesa Nuova, at
the top of the town, we turned to the
cloister of San Francesco, and passed
along it to the terrace, on to which
the beautiful porch opens.</p>

<p>To-day this porch was full of exquisite
effects of light and shadow; near it
is Fra Filippo's massive and finely
proportioned campanile. The name of
the architect of the church is unknown;
but it seems fairly attested that the
campanile was built by Fra Filippo
Campello, who later on became the
architect of the church erected by the
Assisans, on the site of San Giorgio,
in honour of Santa Chiara, or Clara,
the first female convert of St. Francis,
the foundress of the "Poor Clares."</p>

<p class="caption">THE TOWER, SAN FRANCESCO.</p>
</div>

<p>It is strange that the name of the
great architect who designed this beautiful
church and monastery should be
doubtful, especially as San Francesco is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
said to be almost the first Gothic church
built in Italy, and remains to this day
one of the purest and most beautiful
in style, free from that admixture of
Renaissance work which robs so many
Italian churches of the reverence and
religious inspiration created by our
English and so many French cathedrals.
At San Francesco the very walls are
sermons in stone; while, especially in the
Lower Church, the rich beauty of colour
calls out a perpetual hymn of praise.</p>

<p>The offerings made by pilgrims from
all parts of Italy at the tomb of Francis
in San Giorgio had, in the space of two
years, amounted to a sum large enough
to defray the expense of building this
Lower Church.</p>

<p>We went in by the porch to the
atrium; coming from the brilliant sunshine
outside, all seemed so dim that
we feared we should not make out the
frescoes that cover, with mellow, delicious
colour, the walls and low vaults of
nave and side chapels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>

<p>One seems to breathe colour in the
atmosphere of this Lower Church; the
very air is painted, as light comes in
through the stained glass windows,
most of which are worth a careful study.
There are interesting tombs in this
first part of the church, before one enters
the nave; one of the tombs resembles
in its arrangement Giovanni Pisano's
beautiful monument to Pope Benedict <span class="smcap">XI</span>.
at San Domenico, Perugia, but the
Assisan tomb is wholly inferior in
execution. As we stood looking up the
nave, we realised how truly this church
embodies the life and work of Francis
Bernardone; it is a house of prayer
and praise. Its exquisite beauty, both
of architecture and colour, inspires the
joy so continually preached by Francis,
in which he lived, despite his ascetic
privations and self-denying labour for
the good of souls.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe, or even
to name, except generally, the numberless
frescoes which enrich the walls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
the vaultings of the transepts and
chapels; the golden-starred, blue roof
of the nave absorbs the light, but it adds
to the mysterious beauty of the church.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_185" id="i_b_185"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_185.jpg" width="320" height="477" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ENTRANCE DOOR TO LOWER CHURCH, ASSISI.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the first thing that one
admires on entering the nave is the
richly-coloured cross-vaulting above the
high altar, and that between the choir
and transepts. There are four chapels
on the right, and only two on the left
side of the nave; between these two
are the sacristies. There can be no
doubt that in the original plan these
chapels did not exist.</p>

<p>The foundation of the church was
laid in 1228; evidently the walls when
completed were covered with frescoes
by some very early painters, who failed
to satisfy the taste of the Franciscans;
for one can make out portions of old
fresco work near the entrances to the
chapels, the wall here having been
removed when these additions were
made to the original building.</p>

<p>This took place before Cimabue and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
Giunta Pisano and then Giotto and his
pupils came from Florence; followed by
the Lorenzetti and Simone Martino,
from Siena, to make the basilica the
burnished jewel it is to-day. A harmony
of blue and scarlet, of green and
gold, fills one's sight as one looks
onward to the high altar.</p>

<p>We went up to the right transept; here
is the famous Madonna of Cimabue.
Above the arch of the chapel within
the transept is a beautiful fresco by
Giotto, of the Annunciation, part of
a series by that painter of the Infant
Life of our Lord, from the Annunciation
to the Finding the Holy Child in
the Temple; the figures in these frescoes
all tell their own story, and are full of
beauty and dignity. The Annunciation
over the arch leading to the chapel
is especially lovely.</p>

<p>There is also another series of Giotto
frescoes on the wall of this transept;
in one a child is falling from a window;
there are sweet faces among the women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span>
who kneel in front. St. Francis meets
the child as its body is being taken to
burial, and restores it to life. The other
two frescoes also deal with restoration
to life. Our guide said that one of the
faces in these was a likeness of Giotto
Bondone. In this Lower Church are
many frescoes by Giotto's pupils, notably
by Taddeo Gaddi and by Giottino,
who have done very fine work on its
walls. Within the chapel, beyond the
Annunciation, is an interesting series of
frescoes, which represent the story of
St. Nicholas; these are said to be the
work of Giotto's best pupil, name
unknown, some of whose work is also
in the Upper Church. The truth to
nature in the conception, and the
simplicity of this master's work, make
the study of it most fascinating; its
breadth of treatment gives it a peace
and dignity which the solemn stiffness
of Cimabue fails to inspire.</p>

<p>Giotto must have been young when
the Franciscans summoned him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a></span>
adorn the walls of their basilica, for his
work there is supposed to have been
completed in the early years of the
fourteenth century, and he was not
born till 1265.</p>

<p>It is well known how the great artist
Cimabue, on his way from Vespignano,
a village some miles north of Florence,
found among the hills a shepherd lad
of ten years old, named Giotto Bondone,
sketching on a bit of stone, and
how the great Florentine was, on close
inspection of the sketch, so impressed
by the truth to nature shown in the
boy's likeness of one of his sheep, that
he thenceforth adopted Giotto as his
pupil, and took him to Florence, where
for ten years the youth worked in
Cimabue's atelier.</p>

<p>It is strange that the painter should
have so greatly admired the simple
love for and the truthful rendering of
nature which characterises his protégé's
work, for Cimabue himself clung to
the stiff drawing and unlovely ideals of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
Byzantine art, overlaid with gold and
jewels. The most striking feature in
Giotto's work is the life-likeness of his
figures and faces and their surroundings;
and the natural and simple way in
which he portrays action. The faces are
seldom as lovely as those of the Sienese
painters in this church, but there is
no exaggeration about Giotto. Ruskin
says "his imagination was exhaustive
without extravagance."</p>

<p>At Assisi one seems to trace his progress
from these early paintings in the
right transept, to the very excellent
series on the Life of St. Francis in the
Upper Church. Time has probably lent
its mellowing help, but the rich yet soft
harmony of colour is beyond the power
of word-painting,&mdash;it takes complete
possession of the gazer.</p>

<p>The left-hand transept contains the
chapel of San Giovanni. The Franciscans
confided its adornment to Pietro
Lorenzetti of Siena, who covered the
walls with scenes from the Passion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
The colour is rich and remarkable, but
the design is frequently exaggerated.
In the fresco of the Crucifixion, however,
the figures beneath the cross
are beautiful, especially those of the
Madonna, of St. John the Evangelist,
and St. Francis.</p>

<p>Another very interesting chapel, also
on left side of nave below the grille,
which at great functions is closed,
dividing the nave from the transept
and the high altar, is that dedicated
to St. Martin, filled with lovely frescoes
by Simone Martini of Siena, representing
the life and miracles of Martin of
Tours. The faces and figures are delightful,
so is the colour; the story of
the saint is admirably told.</p>

<p>There are also beautiful frescoes by
Simone Martini, or Simone Memmi, as
this Sienese painter is often called,
between the entrances to the chapels
of the Sacrament and that of St. Mary
Magdalene. Many others by Giotto and
his pupils are in the various chapels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span></p>

<p>When we had looked at some of
these, we went back to the high altar,
and, standing there, beneath that
glorious vaulting overhead, we found
it difficult to realise that we were
actually on the place so filled with
memories of the three great revivalists
of purity, for in their respective generations
Francis Bernardone, Dante, and
Giotto strove to regenerate Italy.</p>

<p>After a while, as one stands gazing
at the great lunettes overhead, one can
picture the two friends, Dante and
Giotto, on the space now occupied by
the high altar,&mdash;the imagination of
the poet aiding the skill of the painter
to perpetuate the teaching of the Spouse
of Poverty.</p>

<p>The tomb of St. Francis is in an open
crypt below the high altar; this crypt is
called by the Assisans the Third Church;
the neighbouring peasants frequently
attend the early mass celebrated here.</p>

<p>Owing to the care with which Brother
Elias, who succeeded Francis as Vicar-general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
of the Order, secreted the urn
containing the remains of the saint,
they were not discovered till the year
1818. A tradition had been circulated,
and was firmly believed in, that a third
very beautiful church had been built
underground, and contained the body
of the founder.</p>

<p>This successor of Francis, Fra Elia,
was doubtless proud and ambitious;
his grasping worldliness and irreligion
greatly injured the repute of the
Franciscan community, but in this
special case he acted wisely. Perugia
had determined to possess herself of
the precious body, which drew pilgrims
from all parts of Europe to make offerings
at its shrine; Elias knew this,
and therefore, when the basilica was
completed, and the saint's remains were
removed from their tomb at San
Giorgio to the new church, he buried
them secretly, and surrounded them by
a strongly cemented underground wall
of masonry, which effectually baffled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
all attempts to discover them, though
the Perugians made several attacks on
Assisi for that sole purpose.</p>

<p>In 1818 the Assisans made a more
skilful and sustained excavation. At the
end of two months, spent in piercing
the rock on which the church is built,
and the solid wall of masonry which
seemed part of the rock itself, the
urn was discovered. The excuse for
Elias is that he considered the presence
of the saint's body to be the honour
and glory of the city of Assisi, to say
nothing of the wealth accumulated by
offerings at the shrine.</p>

<p>Overhead is the culminating glory
of the church, the frescoes on the four
central lunettes of the vault, sometimes
considered to be Giotto's finest
work at Assisi. They represent, in
allegory, the poverty, the obedience,
and the chastity enjoined by the saint,
and embodied by him in the rule of
his Order. The fourth spandrel represents
St. Francis in Glory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span></p>

<p>Probably the poet and the painter
stood together on this very spot. Tradition
says that Dante aided his friend
in the conception of these grand designs.
The marriage of Francis to the
Lady Poverty seems to prefigure the
lines in the <i>Paradiso</i>, for Giotto had
finished his work at Assisi before those
lines were written.</p>

<p>In the next compartment, a monk,
a nun, and a lay-brother of the Order
are seen taking the vow of chastity;
they are supposed to represent Bernard
di Quintavalle, the wealthy noble who
became the first disciple of St. Francis;
Santa Chiara, who wears the robe of the
Second Franciscan Order; the lay-brother,
in a Florentine garb, is thought to be
Dante. The Virtue, guarded by angels,
looks out from a tower above. There are
many other figures, mortals, angels, and
demons, who indicate in various ways
the constant struggle and mortification
attendant on the Franciscan calling.
Some of the angels with beautiful faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
are busily engaged repelling the spirits
of the world, the flesh, and the devil,
who strive to tempt the neophyte, a
naked youth who is being baptized by
two angels in a font in middle distance.
The good angels hurl the devils over
the rocks into depths far below.</p>

<p>The third fresco, Obedience, is also
full of allegorical figures, and the Virtue
wears the Franciscan robe. The fourth
fresco shows St. Francis in Glory,
surrounded by throngs of fair-haired
angels, who sing hymns of perpetual
praise. The truth to nature in these
figures is remarkable, some of the faces
are beautiful.</p>

<p>One might fill many pages with detailed
descriptions of the frescoes on the walls
and vaulting of this gemlike church.
It takes several days even to see them,
and therefore it is wiser to spend some
time in Assisi, so as to examine them
in their best light.</p>

<p>So wonderfully picturesque is every
part of this Lower Church, that it is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
difficult to give any idea of such a
storehouse of early Italian art, for both
Upper and Lower Churches seem to
have been a rallying-ground for Giotto
and his pupils, for the early Sienese
masters, and for others following after
Cimabue, Giunta Pisano, and the very
early painters of Italy.</p>

<p>Fra Antonio, the sacristan, was a
most kind and intelligent guide: pointing
out to us the portrait of Francis,
attributed to Giunta da Pisano, he
took us into the sacristy, and let us
see strips of old embroidery mounted
on frames. The faces in this embroidery
were beautifully rendered, and the
colour was delightful. The Fra told us
that some English ladies from Perugia
had so greatly admired the old lace
in the vestiary that he felt sure
we should also like to see it; among
it was some very fine point de Venise,
used to trim surplices. I forget how
old he said it was; some of the vestments
were exquisitely embroidered.

<p class="caption">THE SMALL CLOISTER, SAN FRANCESCO.</p>
</div>

<p>Then he opened a door, and we saw
the quaintest little cloister, surrounded
by the grey convent walls; the garden,
in its grass-grown quadrangle, was
seemingly left to itself. We spied
out rosy cyclamen blossoms dotted
among the grassed hollows of the rough
ground, and our kind Fra, tucking up
the skirts of his cassock, for at San
Francesco the Franciscan habit is not
worn, the conventual garb takes its
place, stepped into the quad, and
gathered a bunch of blossoms, which
he presented to me, with tufts of
maidenhair fern from the low wall
of the cloistered garden. He asked
my companions to come and dig up
roots of both cyclamen and maidenhair.</p>

<p>"The Signori may as well have them,"
he said, with a sigh, "as those who
set no store by them."</p>

<p>He was very kind, but we wondered
what St. Francis would have thought
about the change of costume and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></span>
comparative comfort of these guardians
of his burial-place.</p>

<p>We went back into the basilica, and
up a staircase which led to the east
end of the Upper Church, built some
twenty-one years after the Lower one.
It is a beautiful and graceful example
of early Gothic. The Pope's chair, near
which we entered, is in red marble;
the high altar at that time was
surrounded by a screen, mass being
no longer said there.</p>

<p class="caption">CLOISTER-GARDEN, SAN FRANCESCO.</p>
</div>

<p>Cimabue and other old painters have
covered the walls in this part of the
Upper Church with frescoes, many of
them grand and impressive in design,
though they have greatly suffered from
so-called restoration by unskilful hands,
while damp has damaged others. Some
of the subjects are from the Old Testament,
others from events in the life
of our Lord; the general effect is, however,
rich and harmonious. The long
series taken from the life of St. Francis,
along the lower part of the nave, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
very interesting. There are twenty-eight
subjects, chiefly painted by Giotto;
the rest are said to be executed by
that pupil of the Florentine master
who painted the legend of St. Nicholas
in the Lower Church. Giotto's fine
series in this Upper Church portrays the
saint's history, and contains, I believe,
the best work executed by the artist
in the basilica; it is much later in
date than some of his other Franciscan
frescoes. The painter is said to have
taken as his guide Father Bonaventura's
Life of St. Francis. As this writer
was born during the lifetime of Francis,
and was later on commissioned to write
the saint's Life, his narrative may be
considered reliable. The painting of the
various scenes is masterly, and the
detail in the interesting events here depicted,
the architecture especially, is
rendered in a very striking manner.</p>

<p>These frescoes are so lifelike, that
they stamp yet more strongly into the
mind the impression created by a visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
to Assisi, the truth of the wonderful conversion
and subsequent life of Francesco
Bernardone.</p>

<p>One of the most striking incidents
in this conversion is illustrated in the
fourth fresco of the series, in which
the saint is shown praying before
the crucifix in San Damiano. Those
who have read the beautiful <i>Vie de
Saint François d'Assise</i>, by Monsieur Paul
Sabatier, will understand the meaning
of this fresco, though it has been so
sadly injured by damp. For those who
have not enjoyed this privilege a short
sketch of the saint's life is here added.</p>

<p class="p2">Francis Bernardone was born at Assisi
in 1182, his father being a rich merchant
called Pietro Bernardone. His mother,
Madonna Pica, is said to have been
better born than her wealthy husband,
who travelled, according to the custom
of the time, from one city and castle
to another, journeying sometimes as
far as France, with his company, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
the goods he had to sell. He does
not seem to have taken Francis with
him; he preferred that the youth should
remain at home, and use his singular
power of making friends among the
wild and dissolute young nobles of
Assisi.</p>

<p>Now and again Pietro would ask
for his son's help in his warehouse,
but this was seldom. He wished the
young fellow to distinguish himself
among these prodigals, and therefore
gave him liberal means, so that he might
join in all their sports and amusements,
in their banquets and night revelries.</p>

<p>The whole world of this period seems
to have abandoned itself to every form
of sin and pleasure. There was no discipline,
no self-restraint to be found;
might meant right. Self was everywhere
worshipped, especially among the nobles
and the wealthy.</p>

<p>Francis and his companions did not
lack bravery. They joined the Assisan
troops in resisting an attack made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a></span>
the rival and far more powerful city of
Perugia; the Assisans were defeated,
and Francis, with some of his friends,
was for months imprisoned in a Perugian
dungeon. This gave him leisure for reflection.</p>

<p>Soon after being liberated, he fell ill
of a fever, and could not return to
his former life. He had already begun
to see it with new eyes, and during his
slow recovery fell into a strange melancholy;
rousing from this, he decided to
lead a military life. He would, he told
himself, perform daring feats of valour;
so, when a very distinguished knight
asked him to take service with the
Pope's troops, then warring in Apulia,
Francis eagerly accepted the proposal.</p>

<p>The night before the two friends
started, Francis dreamed that he saw
his father's warehouse, usually stored
with bales of silk, and gold and silver
stuffs, filled with lances and military
accoutrements both for men and horses.
He awoke in great delight. He considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
this dream a good omen for the
success of his expedition, and rode joyfully
next day to Spoleto. A version
of this dream is given on fresco No. 2,
by Giotto, in the Upper Church. At
Spoleto his fever returned, and he heard
a voice telling him he had completely
mistaken the meaning of his dream,
and that he must at once return to his
father's house. Francis obeyed, but on
his return his father and his fellow-citizens
were disgusted by his apparent
cowardice in turning back.</p>

<p>Francis had always been charitable
to the poor, flinging liberal largesses
to them as he rode about the country,
sumptuously dressed and with his horse
richly caparisoned; he now awoke to
the conviction that the poor and suffering
were his fellow-creatures, and
merited a more personal and tender
treatment than he had bestowed
on them. Hitherto he had so dearly
loved his gay companions, that he
grudged every moment spent away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
from them; he even hurried over meals
with his father and mother, so that
he might the more speedily rejoin his
frivolous friends. Now, after his return
from Spoleto, he often went to a grotto,
in a wood near Assisi, and prayed
there; he saw less and less of his companions,
he even sold some of his rich
clothing that he might have more to
give to the poor. In his father's
absence he would clear the table of
all food left on it, and give it among
his poor friends. He had always been
extremely dainty and fastidious in his
habits and tastes, and he especially
shrank from contact with any of the
numerous lepers who, since the return
of the Crusaders, had become a plague
along the high-roads of Europe. One
day he met a leper, and, after giving him
an alms, turned abruptly away; on reflection,
this seemed to him cruel and
uncharitable. Soon afterwards he paid
a visit to the lazar-house, spoke kindly
to the inmates, and gave each leper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a></span>
a special alms, kissing their hands as
he did so. More than once, when he
met a poor man and had not a coin
with him, he would bestow an article
of his own clothing on the beggar.</p>

<p>His gay friends became greatly
troubled at his changed behaviour.
They dearly loved his sweet, fearless
nature, and his winning charm of
manner. They could not spare him
from among them, for they looked on
him as their leader.</p>

<p>They reproached him with his absence,
and implored him to return to
them. Francis announced that he was
going to give them a banquet, and did
so; there was every possible luxury,
the table was magnificently decked,
and he was chosen lord of the feast.
But though he was cheerful, he was
quieter, less full of wild revelry than
he had formerly been, and when they
all left the feast, instead of leading his
companions into the streets of Assisi,
as he had formerly done, he lingered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></span>
behind, till they had to retrace their
steps so as to join him.</p>

<p>They asked what ailed him;&mdash;was
he thinking of marriage?</p>

<p>He remained silent awhile, then he
said:</p>

<p>"You have guessed rightly: I intend
to espouse that most beautiful of brides,
the Lady Poverty. No longer will I
waste my time and dissipate my substance
on follies."</p>

<p>They stared in unbelief, then they
treated it as a jest, but when they
found he was in earnest, they jeered
at their idolised leader.</p>

<p>When Pietro Bernardone learned that
Francis had broken with his former
associates, he became furious. Already
greatly angered by the report of his
son's visits to the lazar-house, and by
other instances of the young fellow's
charity, he could not pardon this public
act of folly.</p>

<p>So long as his son shared the pursuits
of the dissolute nobles who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a></span>
so greatly admired him, so long as
he was to be found in their company,
the arrogant, purse-proud merchant,
keenly desirous to better, as he considered,
his son's position in the world,
had been lavish of his money to the
spendthrift; though even in those wild
days instances are recorded of the
younger Bernardone's goodness to the
poor and suffering.</p>

<p>He therefore sent for Francis.</p>

<p>"You are welcome," he said, "to
spend my money as you please, even
to the half of it, provided you spend
it in the company of noble lords, so
as to bring you, in return, praise and
honour. I covet for you distinction,
and you well know that it can only
be gained from the world; not one
soldo will I give you to bestow on
vile lepers, or on churches and priests.
You are idle, I hear; you spend all your
time in praying."</p>

<p>This tyranny greatly troubled Francis,
though it seems to have helped his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></span>
inward convictions by turning him
more and more from the temptations
to worldliness.</p>

<p>From this time forth the young
fellow's domestic life became a daily
martyrdom, except when his father was
absent for weeks together in pursuit
of business. But on Pietro's return he
always began to persecute his son. This,
joined to the mental suffering endured
by Francis in his struggle after truth,
had greatly affected the young convert's
health.</p>

<p>Outside the Porta Nuova, in the midst
of a wood, was the little ruined church
of San Damiano, served by one poor
priest, who dwelt in a miserable hermitage
beside it. Francis had made
acquaintance with this priest, who, on
his side, was hospitable to the friendless
youth, for not only his former
companions, but the Assisan citizens
sided with his father in condemning
Francis's behaviour. Frequently the
younger Bernardone would spend all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a></span>
night on his knees in the old church
of San Damiano.</p>

<p>He was one day kneeling here in prayer
when he heard a voice calling him. He
listened, and heard it distinctly bid
him seek a closer walk with God; it
told him henceforth to devote himself
to the restoration of God's ruined
houses in Umbria. At that time, owing
partly to the continual warfare and
brigandage under which the country
groaned; also to the frequent visitations
of the plague, which carried off so
many monks who tended the stricken
hospital patients, some religious houses
were almost bereft of their inmates,
very few monks were left to repair
and keep in order the churches and
chapels of Umbria, and many of these
were therefore sadly dilapidated.</p>

<p>Francis felt transported out of himself,
his doubts and difficulties seemed
to vanish before this direct call from
heaven. In his religious fervour he
resolved to quit his father's house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a></span>
now a scene of daily persecution. He
would in future devote himself to the
building up of ruined shrines, and he
would begin with the chapel of San
Damiano. In a fresco by Giotto in the
Upper Church, Francis is seen kneeling
before the crucifix listening to the voice.
The crucifix still exists, but it has been
removed from San Damiano to Santa
Chiara. A part of this fresco is almost
obliterated by damp. Perhaps the most
interesting fresco of the series is that in
which Francis renounces the world before
the bishop and the people of Assisi.</p>

<p>After he had vowed at San Damiano
to devote himself to the reparation of
ruined churches and shrines, he remembered
that he had no money
wherewith to begin his labours. The
remarkable gift he possessed, decision
of character, now impelled him to put
his resolve into instant action.</p>

<p>He hastened back to Assisi, made
into a bundle some rich stuffs, his
own property (not, as has been said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a></span>
goods belonging to his father), then,
bent on speedily repairing the fabric
of San Damiano, Francis rode off along
the valley, to the thriving commercial
town of Foligno, only a few miles
away. In the market of Foligno he
sold all he possessed, even the horse
he rode, with its trappings, and joyfully
returned on foot to San Damiano,
with a bag full of money.</p>

<p>The arrogance and avarice of Pietro
Bernardone were known throughout the
country-side, his quarrels, too, with
his son's new ideas were by this time
public property; so that, when Francis
toiled joyfully up the hill to the chapel,
and offered his bag of money to the
priest, the good man refused to accept
it, warning the young enthusiast that
such a gift would greatly anger the rich
merchant, his father. At this refusal
Francis flung his purse into the window
nook of the chapel, and, turning to the
priest, begged him to feed and lodge
him in his humble dwelling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></span></p>

<p>Pietro was at home, and after a while
became anxious at his son's continued
absence; he went to look for him at
San Damiano. Francis, however, guessing
at his father's anger, had already
found a safe hiding-place in the wood.
When he heard Pietro's fierce reproaches,
he trembled; he then termed
himself a coward to prove thus unworthy
of the call he had received.</p>

<p>He resolved to go back to Assisi, and
announce to his father his choice of
a vocation. His long mental struggle,
his nights spent in prayer and fasting,
his weeks of severe discipline, had
greatly changed his appearance; his
clothing was soiled and torn, his face
pale and emaciated. When he trudged
into Assisi, the town children failed to
recognise him, and, excited by the sight
of this strange beggar, they surrounded
him, crying out, "A madman, a madman!"
throwing stones at him.</p>

<p>The outcry called his father to his
house door; he saw and recognised his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a></span>
son. The furious merchant seized Francis
by the collar, dragged him into the
house, which stood on the site of Chiesa
Nuova, and, after a severe flogging,
flung him into a cellar. Here the young
ascetic was rigorously imprisoned till
Pietro again left home for one of his
business journeys.</p>

<p>He had no sooner gone than Madonna
Pica released and tried to comfort the son
she so dearly loved. Francis soon bade
her adieu, and returned to San Damiano.</p>

<p>But when Pietro came home again,
and found his son absent, it is said that
he gave his wife a beating before he
hurried off to the ruined chapel in the
wood.</p>

<p>This time Francis did not try to hide
himself; but when his father, in a torrent
of reproaches, told him he must
quit the country, because he had brought
such disgrace on his family, the young
fellow respectfully answered:</p>

<p>"Henceforth God is my only Father;
I cannot obey any other."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a></span></p>

<p>Pietro again broke into furious accusation.
He had lavished a fortune on
Francis, he said, and this was the
return he got for it.</p>

<p>For answer, his son pointed to the
bag of money which still lay in the
window nook.</p>

<p>Bernardone eagerly seized it. He swore
that he would appeal to the justice of the
law to punish his son.</p>

<p>He did appeal. Francis was cited
to appear before the magistrate. He
refused to obey the summons; he had
put himself, he said, under the protection
of the Church.</p>

<p>When Bernardone heard of this answer
he appealed to the Ecclesiastical Court;
but the Bishop's answer to the angry
father was a warning. He said that
if Pietro really wished to punish his
son for being good and pious, his only
resource was to persuade Francis to give
up all claim to his patrimony, or he
could, if he chose, disinherit him.</p>

<p>Francis was summoned to the Bishop's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a></span>
palace, on the Piazza Santa Maria
Maggiore. He found the place thronged
by the excited citizens of Assisi. The
Bishop, at that time well disposed
towards the young fellow, advised him
to end the quarrel with his father by
renouncing all claim to his inheritance.</p>

<p>When Francis heard this counsel, his
face beamed with joy. He stripped
off his clothing, rolled it into a bundle,
and laid it and the few coins he still
possessed at the feet of the Bishop.
He then turned to the wonder-struck
citizens of Assisi:</p>

<p>"Mark all of you," he said, "I have
given back my possessions to Pietro
Bernardone; I once called him father,
hereafter I address myself altogether to
our Father which is in Heaven."</p>

<p>Pietro pushed forward; he snatched
up the money and the clothing.</p>

<p>This drew a loud murmur from the
Assisans, for the rich merchant's arrogance
and avarice had alienated his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a></span>
fellow-townsmen; he had grown to be
unpopular.</p>

<p>The compassionate Bishop at once
flung his own cloak over the youth's
shivering shoulders; his charity drew
forth a pitying chorus of approval.
The people, who had hitherto despised
Francis as a fool, saw him suddenly
in a new light; they marvelled at this
singular proof of self-abnegation.</p>

<p>Thus the first-fruits of his mission
were reaped from the impression created
in many of these bystanders, who during
the past two years had scornfully witnessed
and mocked at his good deeds and
his devout life.</p>

<p>The reality of the scene represented in
this fresco is marvellous; it at once tells
its own story. The compassionate Bishop
puts his cloak round the naked youth,
who holds up his hands in the act of
renunciation, while the stern-looking
Pietro bustles forward to snatch at the
money and clothing, and also apparently
to strike a blow at his son, but is held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a></span>
back by a wealthy-looking fellow-citizen
in an ermine-lined cloak and tippet.</p>

<p>In another fresco Francis is preaching
to the birds at Bevagna; in another
we see the arid summit of La Vernia
above the Casentino valley, where, in his
later years, he is said to have received the
Stigmata. Another fresco full of beauty
and interest is called "The Mourning
of the Nuns of San Damiano." It shows
how, after the saint's death, his body
was carried past the convent of San
Damiano, on its way to sepulture at
San Giorgio; the saintly Clara had been
for some years Abbess of the little
convent in the wood, and she and
the Poor Clares, her Sisters, wept over
the body of their beloved founder.</p>

<p>These frescoes, and the thoughts they
recall, are deeply interesting, and yet
the Upper Church is not so delightful
as the Lower one is,&mdash;at least, we did
not find it so fascinating, although,
in addition to the frescoes, the painted
windows are full of beauty; there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a></span>
rather too much light; one misses the
rich mellowness of atmosphere which
fills the Lower Church with a dim
mystery of splendid colour, especially
one misses the work of the Sienese
painters.</p>

<p>The way to La Vernia, judging by
the fresco, must have been terribly
rugged. The favourite resort of St.
Francis, when he retired from the distractions
of life at La Portioncula, to
give himself more fully to prayer and
contemplation, was Le Carceri; the cells
are still to be seen in a ravine on the
side of rugged Monte Subasio, some
way north of San Damiano. Le Carceri
is a series of caves in the solid rock,
containing the monks' cells; it is backed
by a wood, and has the hill torrent
before it. The walk there from Assisi
is full of beauty, and it is not a very
long way from Piazza Nuova, leaving
Assisi by Porta Cappucini. Here the
saint had frequent talk with the birds
in the woods near Le Carceri; the ilex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></span>
tree is still shown on which the winged
disciples perched while Saint Francis
talked with them.</p>

<div class="fig_red_side p4"><a name="i_b_224fp" id="i_b_224fp"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_224fp.jpg" width="472" height="364" alt="" />
<p class="drop-cap p2">OUTSIDE<br />
SAN FRANCESCO</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">It was at Le Carceri that he invited
the nightingale to try which could sing
longest to the praise and glory of God.
Brother Leo declined to join in this
trial, but the saint and the nightingale
sang on through the night, till Francis,
completely exhausted, had to yield victory
to the bird.</p>

<p>While we stood gazing at the frescoes,
thinking of all these things, Fra Antonio
said softly:</p>

<p>"The Signora and the Signori have
now seen all I can to-day show them."</p>

<p>We longed to linger, but already
the kind man had given us much of
his time; he quaintly added, "It is,
moreover, my dinner-hour."</p>

<p>Then we took leave of the kind
Fra, and said we would come again.
We went out by the west door under
the fine window, and rejoiced in the
very lovely view before us. We wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a></span>
our guide a good appetite, and he
stood watching us as we went down
one flight of the double range of steps
leading from the Piazza of the Upper
Church to the Lower one.</p>

<p>We were tired when we came out
into the sunshine, and we sat down
in the shade opposite a fountain, at
the foot of the steps.</p>

<p>A girl came presently up the hill
behind us, her bare feet white with
dust. She carried on her red-kerchiefed
head a tall copper pitcher with dinges
which bespoke it the worse for wear;
her skirt was short and dark, and
the light blue bodice laced up behind
showed a white undervest. In a
minute she began to run fast, deftly
balancing the tall pitcher. Then we
saw behind her a long-legged lad,
evidently bent on arriving first at the
fountain. The two figures seemed to
fly along the dusty road; the lad
outran the girl, and, when she reached
him, panting and choking with laughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></span>
he had the courtesy to fill her pitcher
for her, and helped her in raising it to
her head.</p>

</div>

<p>It is wonderful how these women can
so surely support the loads they carry
on their heads; the burden is sometimes
a huge round basket, three feet across,
full of grapes or heavy vegetables.</p>

<p>We rarely saw a man thus burdened;
he seems to content himself in Italy,
as he does in France, with looking on
and admiring, while the women do the
work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="s08">ASSISI&mdash;IN THE TOWN</span></h2>

<p>Our little hotel, the Albergo Subasio,
is close to San Francesco, and
from its windows commands a most
exquisite view of the valley and the
richly-tinted hills. If time served, one
could spend hours in enjoying the beauty
of this landscape, so full of colour and
of variety.</p>

<p>We passed by San Francesco, and
up the long, solemn street which it
seems to guard. Grass grows freely between
the stones that pave the street,
which mounts very steeply; farther
up were shops, but all were full of
silence. No one seemed to be alive
within the dark openings on either
side, though from the wares displayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a></span>
it was evident that inhabitants were
not far off; doubtless all sound asleep
at this time of day.</p>

<p>At the top of the street on either
side are tall old grey palaces; one
of these, on the right, has a projecting
roof, supported by long and beautifully-carved
brackets. This is the
Ospedale, with its curious door. On
the left is the Palazzo Allemanni; over
every door and window is the legend,
<i>In Domino confido</i>.</p>

<p>The blue mountains, each range paler
and more exquisite in tint as it rose
behind another, were seen through a
glimmering veil of sparsely-planted
olives, and seemingly ended the street
we were mounting; but, going on, we
presently came out on the Piazza di
Minerva.</p>

<p>Here is a fine, very ancient portico,
supported by five columns of travertine,
once the front of a temple to Minerva.
Behind it is the more modern church
of Santa Maria della Minerva. We were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></span>
now on the site of old Roman Assisi, for
the Forum lies below the Piazza, and
one goes down steps to it. Formerly
a flight of steps in front of the temple
led to the Forum, and the effect must
have been very fine; now the artificially
raised ground of the Piazza takes away
from the apparent height of the portico,
which has no longer so lofty a position
in the general view as of old. It seems
a pity that the space round it is not
clearer.</p>

<p>Up a turning not far from the
Temple of Minerva we came to the
cathedral of Assisi, San Rufino, built
by Giovanni da Gubbio in twelfth
and early part of thirteenth century.
It has an interesting brown façade
and a picturesque campanile; its three
fine doorways and rose windows are
full of beauty, but the interior is comparatively
modernised, although a triptych
by Niccolo da Foligno is worth
seeing. There are many frescoes and
pictures in Assisi, by Matteo da Gualdo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a></span>
Tiberio di Assisi, l'Ingegno, and one
at least by that rarely found master,
Fiorenzo di Lorenzo. There are some
in the small church of San Paolo,
near the Temple of Minerva, some in
the Palazzo Pubblico, and elsewhere.
Beyond the Piazza Grande is the house
wherein Metastasio was born.</p>

<p>But we found it difficult to detach
our interest from Francis Bernardone,
who is truly the moving spirit of Assisi,
and, turning downwards to the right,
we were soon in the little square of
Chiesa Nuova. We knocked at the
church door, and, after some delay, a
very old monk, wearing the Franciscan
habit, opened it.</p>

<p>He only nodded or shook his head
in answer to our questions. The interest
attaching to Chiesa Nuova lies wholly
in the fact that it stands on the site
of the Bernardone house. The shop
of El Poverello's father is still preserved
in the Via Portici. The high
altar in Chiesa Nuova is supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></span>
occupy the place of the saint's bedchamber;
a side-chapel on the right
is an unaltered room of the house, that
in which his mother, Madonna Pica,
dreamed her wonderful dream. The
door is still standing at which, in her
vision, the angel appeared to her, with
the tidings that her expected child would
be born in a stable; this is said to
be a later invention of the Franciscans.
There is a dark cave in the church,
said to be part of the cellar in which
his father imprisoned Francis to cure
him of his so-called fanatical follies.
It looked dismayingly dismal. He was
probably flung in here on his return
from San Damiano. The little Piazza
before the church was not that which
witnessed the young saint's renunciation
of the world, and heard his memorable
vow. That scene took place in front of
the now decayed romanesque church
of Santa Maria Maggiore, near the
Bishop's palace. This was one of the
churches partly restored by St. Francis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
who rebuilt its eastern end. It was probably
on the Piazza here that Francis
flung down money and clothing, and,
sheltered only by the Bishop's mantle,
borrowed the serge garment of a rough
countryman, and began his new life.</p>

<p>Francis, when he left the Piazza, was
free. He at once set to work to repair
San Damiano, begging bricks and other
needful materials from the more charitable
of the citizens. He next restored
another chapel in the neighbourhood;
this completed, he fell to work on
the wayside shrine to which his mother
had often taken him as a child, the
well-known chapel of the Little Portion
of St. Mary, or, as it is to this day called,
La Portioncula.</p>

<p>It belonged to the Benedictine abbey
on the heights of Subasio, whence
a priest occasionally came down the
mountain to celebrate mass for worshippers.
Francis found much comfort
in this service, and it was a delight
to him to restore with his own hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
the little building to a weather-proof
condition.</p>

<p>One day the Gospel read by the
officiating priest greatly impressed
Francis; it seemed to him that the
life he was leading could not be altogether
pleasing to God, because its
aim was only the saving of his own
soul: he ought surely to incite others
to share the light he had received.
From this time there began in him
that intense hunger after souls which
was, next to his love of God, the chief
motive-power of his life. He had
once been pre-eminent in folly, and by
his vainglorious and prodigal example
had led many souls to sin: he was
bound, he decided, not only to submit
himself joyfully to every trial, as a
means sent to subdue his will and
his self-pleasing nature, but he must
try to prevail on others to follow the
same discipline.</p>

<p>His character seems to have developed
with every fresh demand on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></span>
his exertions, a development caused
not so much by impulse, as by a
humble feeling that he had not done
nearly enough to prove his penitence.</p>

<p>He walked to Assisi, and began to
preach in its streets. He at once attracted
listeners; disciples soon followed.</p>

<p>The first of these was a wealthy
noble, called in the <i>Fioretti</i> and elsewhere
in connection with Francis, Bernard di
Quintavalle. This nobleman, also called
in the <i>Fioretti</i>, "Bernard of Assisi, who
was of the noblest and richest and
wisest in the city," wisely began to
take heed unto St. Francis,&mdash;how exceeding
strong must be his contempt of
the world, how great his patience in the
midst of wrongs, because albeit abominated
and despised for two whole years
by everyone, he seemed yet more patient;
Bernard began to think and to say to
himself, "This could not be, unless the
Brother has the fulness of God's grace."
He invited the preacher that evening
to sup and lodge with him, and St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
Francis consented thereto.... Thereat
Bernard set it in his heart to watch
his sanctity, wherefore he let make
ready for him a bed in his own proper
chamber, in the which, at night-time,
ever a lamp did burn. And St. Francis,
for to hide his sanctity, when he was
come into the chamber, incontinent did
throw himself upon the bed, and made
as though he slept; and likewise Bernard,
after some short space, did lie him
down, and fell to snoring loudly....
St. Francis, thinking truly that Bernard
slept, rose up from his bed, and set
himself to pray ... "My God, my
God" at intervals through the night.
When morning came, Bernard professed
himself ready to become a follower
of the new teaching. Francis, though
overjoyed in his heart, told his convert
that this was a task so great and
difficult that it behoved them to seek
for Divine guidance in the matter. He
proposed that they should go together
to the Bishop's house, and find there a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span>
good priest he knew; and, after mass had
been said for them, that the priest,
at the request of Francis, should open
the missal thrice and read each time
the words at which it opened.</p>

<p>At the first opening the words were,
"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
that thou hast," etc.</p>

<p>At the second opening the words
were, "Take nothing for your journey,"
etc.</p>

<p>At the third, "If any one will come
after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross and follow me."</p>

<p>Bernard at once obeyed Christ's
words: he sold all his possessions, distributed
his money among the poor
and suffering, and went to live with
El Poverello, as Francis was called,
in a small hut not far from the lazar-house.
The house of Bernard still
stands, also the room in which the
friends talked; it is now called Palazzo
Sbaraglini, and is in the same street
as the home of Clara Scifi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></span></p>

<p>The next convert who came to seek
Francis in the hut, to ask leave to
share his labours in tending the lepers,
was the learned Pietro di Cataneo, a
canon of the cathedral of San Rufino.
The third was Fra or Fratello Egidio,
called in English "Brother Giles,"
a poor labourer, who proved to be
one of the most remarkable of the
group termed by Francis his "Knights
of the Round Table." Egidio seems
to have been willing as well as able
to set his hand to any work he was
asked to do. Besides helping to tend
the lepers, these men begged their daily
bread in the streets of Assisi, and
Francis preached constantly, sometimes
in several adjacent villages the same day,
so fervently that crowds flocked to listen.</p>

<p>The number of penitents soon increased,
and, seeing this, Bishop Guido
of Assisi, at first so kind, grew jealous
of the new power of the penitent
brothers. He advised Francis to join
either the Dominican community, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></span>
the Benedictines, a branch of whom
had already established themselves on
the heights of Subasio.</p>

<p>"Your present life," the Bishop said,
"is impracticable."</p>

<p>Francis answered that, "as the Bishop
knows, money is at the root of all
quarrels, therefore I and my brother
penitents, wishing to live in peace,
prefer to be without it."</p>

<p>As time went on the number of
penitents increased. Francis was perplexed
how to dispose of them; he
felt also that if he could gain the
Papal sanction the power of his mission
would be strengthened. He resolved to
make a pilgrimage to Rome, in order
to ask Pope Innocent the Third to
consider his Rule, and to give it his
approval.</p>

<p>Eleven of the brothers went with
him cheerfully to the Imperial City,
singing hymns of praise as they walked.
They were received very coldly: it was
considered that such a dusty, travel-soiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></span>
handful of men, with so small
and insignificant a leader, could not
have the capacity to found a new
Order, and that its Rule of Poverty,
Obedience, and Chastity was unseemly
and preposterous.</p>

<p>But when at length Francis was admitted
to the Pope's presence, Innocent
saw in the face of his suppliant something
that pleaded too powerfully to be
resisted, and, after a little more delay,
against the advice of his worldly,
pleasure-loving cardinals, he gave his
sanction to the objectionable Rule, and
named the new community, The Order
of Brothers Minor.</p>

<p>They quitted Rome as soon as they
could; they seem to have suffered much
privation on their homeward journey,
so that they were glad, as they approached
Assisi, to find and take refuge
in a small, empty dwelling at Rivo
Torto, near the leper-house.</p>

<p>They established themselves here,
but their number increased so rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
that they soon outgrew their quarters,
and were shown that they were unwelcome
guests.</p>

<p>When he found that he and his
followers could no longer live by themselves
at Rivo Torto, Francis went to
Guido, the Bishop of Assisi, and begged
to be allowed the use of an oratory,
or of any chapel, in which he and his
brethren could say the Hours of Prayer.
He was told that no such building
could be allotted him; and, almost
weeping with earnestness and baffled
hope, Francis climbed the side of Subasio
till he reached, near the top, the abbey
of the Benedictines. As this side of the
great hill belonged to the Abbot, the
kindly man, who seems to have fully
sympathised with Francis, granted him
the chapel of "the Little Portion of St.
Mary," to have and to hold for his own.</p>

<p>At once the overjoyed Francis and
his disciples, as has been said, set to
work and built themselves huts to
dwell in, near their place of worship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a></span></p>

<p>Next to the rapidity with which the
new Order made its way, its most remarkable
feature was its social aspect.</p>

<p>In those days, when the haughty
nobles and the still more haughty
Church dignitaries seem to have ignored
the existence of the peasantry, we find
in the Franciscan brotherhood, from
its beginning, a complete union of all
classes. Its first four members were a
canon, a nobleman, a rich merchant's
son, and a labourer.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Scifi, in which the
future Santa Chiara (the first member
of the Second Order founded by St.
Francis) was born, is only a very short
distance from the church, afterwards
built on the site of the old San Giorgio,
and called, in memory of the Abbess of
the Poor Clares, Santa Chiara.</p>

<p>On his return from Rome, when it
became public talk that he had received
tonsure, with the Pope's sanction to
his Rule for the Order of Brothers
Minor,&mdash;Frati Minori, as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a></span>
called,&mdash;Francis found himself in much
higher favour with the Assisans.</p>

<p>Instead of the street preaching he
and his Brothers had daily practised, he
was offered the pulpit of San Giorgio;
but that church was found too small
for the multitudes who flocked to hear
El Poverello, he was therefore invited to
preach in the cathedral of San Rufino.
This was considered a great honour, and
it fixed public attention on the founder
of the new brotherhood.</p>

<p>It was in San Rufino that this beautiful
young girl, named Clara Scifi, daughter
of the powerful Count Favorini Scifi, as
despotic as he was powerful, heard the
new preacher. Listening with rapt attention
to these new doctrines of Poverty,
Obedience, and Chastity for the love
and glory of God, and in imitation
of his life, the girl contrasted this
teaching with the life lived around
her. This new way, the way of the
Cross, opened out to her a new revelation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></span></p>

<p>At that time, her father, a cruel
and violent despot, had just laid his
commands on her, his elder daughter,
to wed a young noble of Assisi. While
the girl listened to the saintly preacher,
her heart and mind were deeply stirred;
she determined to ask the Poverello's
advice in her trouble. How could she
follow out the purpose that had formed
in her heart, that of leading the life
he pictured, if she wedded the husband
destined for her by her father. Her
mother, the Lady Ortolana del Fiume,
a daughter of the Fiumi, those hated
enemies of the Baglioni of Perugia,
and rivals of the Nepi of Assisi, was
a devout and good woman. But
Clara shrank from consulting her on
this subject, lest she might breed
discord between her parents; she therefore
opened her heart to her aunt,
Bianca Guelfucci, who seems fully to
have sympathised with her niece's perplexity.</p>

<p>Francis was sorely troubled when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></span>
trembling girl sought him out at the
Portioncula, and begged him to advise
her. He said she must not act rashly,
she must prove the reality of her vocation
before he could counsel her to
take the veil, and thus withdraw herself
from her parents' guardianship. He
bade her wrap herself in a sackcloth
robe, with a hood drawn over her head
so as to conceal her face, and thus, clad
like a mendicant, beg her bread from
door to door through the town of Assisi.
Clara did this secretly; but it only
added to the fervent strength of her
vocation, and finally Francis consented
to her wish.</p>

<p>On the night of Palm Sunday the
girl quitted the Scifi Palace, and,
accompanied by her aunt Bianca
Guelfucci and a waiting-maid, went
rapidly out by the Porta Nuova, and
across the starlit plain. As they drew
near the little brown chapel, surrounded
by a thick wood, they heard the Brothers
of the Poor chanting a Psalm, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a></span>
waiting till this had ceased, the trembling
Clara knocked on the door and
asked leave to enter.</p>

<p>Francis bade her come in, and he
questioned her a little, then bade her
kneel; she obeyed, and took the vows he
prescribed, after which he cut off all her
golden hair and laid it as an offering on
the altar. When her companion had
wrapped her in the veil and sackcloth
garment of the Order, El Poverello led
her and her aunt, through the dark
night, to the way they had to follow to
reach the convent of the nuns of San
Paolo, about an hour's distance from
Assisi. He told her that she would there
be safe from persecution.</p>

<p>This Second Order of Franciscans
was called, when Clara had established
herself at San Damiano, the Sisterhood
of "the Poor Clares." Her
sister Agnes soon joined Clara, provoking
the stormy displeasure of her father
and her uncle, who was savagely cruel
in his treatment of this young girl. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></span>
church of Santa Chiara was built after
Clara's death by Fra Campello, in red
and cream-coloured marble. It has a
graceful campanile, and the flying buttresses
are very remarkable; they spring
completely across the pathway beside
the church.</p>

<p>The building was begun in the year
after Santa Clara's death, but the nuns
remained at San Damiano for fifteen
years longer; then the body of their
foundress was removed to Santa Chiara,
and they took up their abode in the
convent adjoining the church. There
are interesting pictures in this fine
building, especially in the chapel of
San Giorgio, and by this date the
chapel probably contains the famous
and very ancient crucifix brought
here from San Damiano, before which
Francis was kneeling when he heard
the voice bidding him rebuild the
ruined houses of God. This crucifix
was, I think, when we saw it, in the
convent of Santa Chiara, but we heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a></span>
that it would be placed by the altar
of the chapel.</p>

<p>Santa Chiara was built on the site
of the old church, San Giorgio, the
first burial-place of Francis, but it is
not clear how much of the original
edifice was spared by Fra Campello
when he designed the new building;
there is much mention of the older
church in the <i>Life of Francis Bernardone</i>.
Clara was buried in the chapel
of San Giorgio, but her tomb there was
not discovered till 1850.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the town
at this discovery; her remains were
carried through Assisi with much splendour
of ceremonial, and were followed
by an immense procession. The coffin
was reburied in a crypt made to receive
it in front of the high altar,
reached by a double flight of steps.
The public are permitted to go down
to view the body of the saint in a
glass case; candles are ever burning
before it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a></span></p>

<p>We did not, however, visit the crypt,
and our gentle-faced conductress seemed
surprised by our lack of devotion.</p>

<p>When we set out to visit San
Damiano, and again passed by the
church of Santa Chiara, we noticed
the contrast of colour between the
rose-tinted church and the brown convent
walls.</p>

<p>We followed the road till it reached
a gate on the brow of the hill. Here
is a lovely view over rugged hill and
fertile valley, wilder and more picturesque
than any we saw from Perugia.
A breeze had sprung up; now and again
a light purple cloud-shadow varied the
rosy tint of Subasio, already darkened
in places by ravines that gaped in
his rugged side, while the glint of a
mountain rill showed here and there
like a stray gem on the grassy tufts
that helped to mark its course. Leaving
the gate, we went down the steep
descent on the right, between silvery
veils, the deep valleys being clothed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></span>
with olive-groves; their pale leaves
gleamed in the sunshine against bright
green berries, and ancient trunks so
gnarled and shrunken that we wondered
at the abundant crop of fruit overhead.
Huge brown patches glowed like
velvet on these grey trunks; and
through the silver veil we saw ranges
of hills in varied shades of blue, a
more delicate tint indicating the valleys
that lay between them.</p>

<p>There was not anywhere a hope of
shade, unless we climbed the bank and
walked on the rough ground under
the olive-trees, but these did not grow
closely enough to give shelter worth
having, and the road under foot being
fairly smooth, we trudged downhill in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>The way proved longer than we expected.
At last, concealed among trees,
we found San Damiano.</p>

<p>We rang a bell beside the entrance;
after a long pause, our summons
was answered by a beautiful young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></span>
Franciscan, who showed us about very
courteously. He first took us into the
quaint little chapel, and pointed out
an ancient crucifix; he told us how
an angel had come during the night,
and had carved the unfinished head of
the figure. He showed us on the
right of the entrance the hole below
the window into which St. Francis
flung the money gained at Foligno by
the sale of his possessions; also, he
showed the little cracked bell with
which Santa Chiara summoned her
Sisters to prayer.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn that, though
she ran away from her father's house at
night to adopt a religious life, Clara's
mother, the Lady Ortolana, after Count
Scifi's death, was received into the Second
Order, and joined the community under
her daughter's rule, then called the Poor
Ladies of San Damiano.</p>

<p>Behind the little chapel is the choir of
the nuns, left just as it was when Santa
Chiara died. The refectory on the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a></span>
side of the cloisters is also unaltered,
and above it is the dormitory of the
nuns; at the end is Clara's cell. Every
step makes the poetic history more
real. There is still the little garden
in which this sweet, brave woman took
daily exercise, and tended the flowers
she so dearly loved.</p>

<p>When we came out we found the artist
of our party sketching. Beside him was
a small boy about seven years old, a
curiosity as to clothing. He had on
part of some ragged knee-breeches,
the remains of a shirt, and a portion
of a straw hat; he seemed a bright,
intelligent little fellow. He was very
much interested in the sketch, and
delighted to be talked to in his own
language. Between his praises he held
out a grimy little hand, in a saucy,
smiling way.</p>

<p>Said the artist, "How much would
you like, my man,&mdash;would a hundred
lire suit you?"</p>

<p>The urchin grinned all over. "Si,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a></span>
Signore, I should much like a hundred
lire, but I would take less!"</p>

<p>We went back up the olive-bordered
hills to the pleasant little inn, which
seems to hang over the lovely valley
behind the house. Just before reaching
Hotel Subasio there is a picturesque
view looking upwards, the great convent
and churches of San Francesco towering
above us.</p>

<p>Even apart from the touching interest
with which the story of St. Francis invests
the little town, Assisi is delightful,
so many churches and religious houses
exist there, full of picturesque charm is
the exquisite setting of landscape beyond
and around them.</p>

<p>Wherever one looks between the old
grey houses, one sees the valley full of
rich colour, and the far-off, softened
outlines of the hills. The town on
market-days is very bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>It is a steep climb up to the old grey
castle, the Rocca di Assisi; it sits there
crowning the hill like a falcon in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a></span>
eyrie, the little town beneath its feet;
and what a wonderful prospect it
dominates!</p>

<p>To the west is Perugia, on its group
of hills; eastward glistens many another
town, sometimes sheltered in a hollow
of the hills, sometimes standing out as
Foligno does on the plain beyond.</p>

<p>Behind the castle there is the wildest
of ravines; Monte Subasio is full of
strange nooks and glens, of which the
most interesting is that of Le Carceri,
the group of cells built in the mountain
caves by Francis and his brethren. He
retired here for prayer and penance
when he found his life at the Portioncula
distracting. Close by is the little
mountain stream of the Tescio, and the
ilex-wood in which Francis held discourse
with the nightingale.</p>

<p>In thinking and writing about St.
Francis, one forgets the history of Assisi.
Till the Roman invasion of Umbria,
this history seems chiefly traditional.
Dardanus is said to have built Assisi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a></span>
before he built Troy; in consequence
of a dream that came to him while he
lay sleeping on the slope of Subasio, he
founded the famous Temple of Minerva,
and the city grew up round it.</p>

<p>Goethe greatly displeased the Assisans
by journeying to their city only to see
this temple; he passed by San Francesco
without so much as entering the church.</p>

<p>The number of subterranean passages
leading to the Rocca from all parts
of the town seems to prove that the
little city greatly needed shelter from
surrounding foes.</p>

<p>From the time that the Etruscans
possessed themselves of a large part of
Umbria, and built the city of Perugia,
Assisi was constantly persecuted by
this powerful neighbour, till the Romans
overspread the country, conquering the
Etruscans, and the grim, hitherto unconquered
city of Perugia, burning most
of it to the ground.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, Assisi had frequently
to submit to the despotism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a></span>
of great leaders of Condottieri and
others who bore rule in Perugia,&mdash;Galeazzo
Visconti, Biordo Michelotti,
Forte Braccio of Montone, Nicola
Piccinino, Sforza, and others. Before
these, however, Charlemagne is said to
have taken the city and utterly destroyed
it. After its destruction, the
citizens built walls around their new
town, they also built the castle on the
hilltop. This was at one time occupied
by Frederick Barbarossa, and then by
Conrad of Suabia and other despots.</p>

<p>The two noble houses of the Fiumi
and the Nepi, one being Guelph and
the other Ghibelline, though less bloodthirsty
than the Baglioni and the Oddi
of Perugia, seem to have been constantly
at strife till the advent of St.
Francis, who prevailed on them to
live more peaceably.</p>

<p>Later on there was again terrible
strife and carnage in Assisi, and when
his lordship the Magnifico Gianpaolo
Baglione took upon himself to settle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
matters, famine and misery almost destroyed
the inhabitants of the brave
little city. Miss Lina Duff Gordon, in
the chapter called "War and Strife"
of her charming <i>Story of Assisi</i>, gives
a vivid account of this siege.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<img src="images/i_b_260.jpg" width="66" height="97" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is better, perhaps, after visiting
Chiesa Nuova, to go
next to St. Mary of the
Angels at the foot of
the hill, instead of visiting
San Francesco, the saint's memorial
church; for at the Portioncula, within
the walls of Santa Maria, Francis
lived and worked and died. Most of
the Brothers whose names have come
down to us were received into the
Order within the walls of the little
chapel.</p>

<p>The vast baldness of Santa Maria's
nave, rebuilt less than a hundred years
ago, in consequence of the damage
caused by an earthquake, was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
uninteresting, but at the east end is
the brown Portioncula, the home of
Francis and of his first followers; for
the little chapel remained uninjured
when the earthquake shattered the
walls of the outer church.</p>

<p>The dark walls of the Portioncula
are covered with votive offerings, and
over the entrance is a fresco by Overbeck.
Looking within, it is difficult to
imagine how the events recorded in
the <i>Fioretti</i> could have found room to
happen in the tiny place.</p>

<p>On the right is a chapel, the site
of the cell of St. Francis; his portrait
is over the altar, and there are frescoes
of his companions. Our guide, a
Franciscan, looked as if he had come
direct from the thirteenth century,
but he had not brought thence the
warm, loving glow that must have
radiated from the founder of his Order.</p>

<p>The great interest of the place is
its story. The Portioncula was a well-known
shrine, and had existed for years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></span>
before Francis restored it from its
ruinous condition. It has been told
how, when he was a child, the saint
was often taken by his mother to the
little chapel, and prayed there beside
her. Two years after he renounced his
home and his father, Francis was kneeling
here in prayer when he received
his second inspiration. According to
his biographers, he hastily rose, and,
taking up a bit of cord near at hand,
tied it round his waist, as the outward
badge of the Order of Poor Brethren.</p>

<p>Our guide's scanty hair stood erect,
and his red-veined blue eyes stared at
us, as the Gorgons did in the Etruscan
tomb. At first he would scarcely
speak. He may have thought heretics
would not appreciate his information.
When we came to the little rose-garden
outside the Chapel of the Roses, and
talked to him about flowers, he thawed;
he told us how an unbelieving English
traveller had begged a rose-tree, so
that he might try it in English soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a></span>
and how next year the Englishman
had written to say that the rose-tree
was covered with thorns; whereas at
Santa Maria degli Angeli, these roses,
brought here from St. Benedict's monastery
near Subiaco, have been thornless
ever since the day when St. Francis
carried the original bushes from the
Benedictine garden at Il Sacro Speco,
and planted them here.</p>

<p>Our guide said we ought to pay our
next visit when the roses were in blossom,
"a sight to be met with in no other
place." He took us into a chapel,
where, under the altar, is the den into
which the saint retired for penance&mdash;a
most wretched hole; then we went into
the sacristy, to see a Perugino. In
another little chapel is the portrait of El
Poverello, a very remarkable face, painted
on a plank which once formed part of
the saint's bed. There is a terra-cotta
statue of him by Andrea della Robbia.</p>

<p>We went back to the church, and
looked again at the Portioncula. In it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a></span>
Clara, or Chiara, took the vows, and
here her beautiful hair was shorn from
her head by St. Francis. Other memories
of Santa Chiara cling about this
church of Santa Maria. Perhaps the
Third, or universal, Order was here
determined on. The space outside has
never been built on, because it was
here that the memorable meeting took
place between Clara and St. Francis, in
answer to her repeated petitions that
they might eat bread together. The
meeting is very quaintly described in
<i>I Fioretti</i>. Clara had often asked for
this privilege; this time the Brothers
seconded her request, and Francis
granted it. He had, as soon as was
possible, obtained for her the little
church of San Damiano, and had built
up little huts beside it for her and the
poor ladies, who so soon joined her
community. Clara passed the rest of
her life among the Sisters, and died
Abbess of the "Poor Clares" of San
Damiano.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span></p>

<p>The community of Brethren met on
the open space twice yearly; the great
chapter of the Order convened by St.
Francis eleven years after its beginning,
recorded in the <i>Fioretti</i>, took place
on this vacant ground. The number
of the brethren must have increased
very rapidly, for several thousands
came over the hills and along the
valleys from far-off parts of Italy to
look their founder in the face, and to
receive his instructions and his blessing.
Among others came San Dominic, with
some of his followers, and the Bishop
of Ostia, Cardinal Ugolino, afterwards
Pope Gregory <span class="smcap">IX.</span></p>

<p>The space occupied by Santa Maria
must have been covered by the village
of huts built by St. Francis and his
Brothers. In an old map, these huts are
shown built at regular distances on three
sides of the Portioncula; among them
is one larger than the rest, probably
the Refectory or the Infirmary of the
Brothers. Doubtless they lived here a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a></span>
happy family life, though Francis began
early to send them out to found branches
of the Order in other directions. The
first sent away from the nest-like home
was Bernard of Quintavalle, to Bologna;
here he had to suffer insult and persecution,
but he soon won many converts
by his preaching, and established a
community of Brothers Minor in that
city, over which Francis appointed him
guardian. This enterprise was repeated
over and over again, with success, till,
in his hunger after souls, several years
later, El Poverello set forth with a couple
of Brothers to Damietta to convert the
Soldan, who is said to have permitted
him to visit the Holy Sepulchre. His
visit failed in its object, but it is spoken
of by Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre,
as a fact.</p>

<p>He was never tired of exhorting his
brethren to live joyfully, so as to make
others happy. Their cares and the
sorrow for sin which would from time
to time beset them, they should, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a></span>
told them, pour out to God in their
prayers; he also exhorted them to live
always according to the Rule of the
Order.</p>

<p>The Popes seem to have troubled
him by their persistent efforts to persuade
him to alter the extreme simplicity
of this Rule, and to assimilate
his teaching with that of the other
Orders. But St. Francis, always most
humble and gentle in his denials, pleaded
so earnestly and so sweetly for the
original lines on which he had begun,
that he succeeded in gaining his
point both with Innocent the Third,
and his successor Honorius. Even his
dear friend Ugolino, the Cardinal Bishop
of Ostia, tried hard, when he succeeded
to the Papacy as Pope Gregory the
Ninth, to convince El Poverello that
union with the Dominican Order would
be a gain to the Church, but the saint's
sweet humility at last conquered Ugolino.
These discussions, however, which made
needful journeys to and from Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></span>
involved much loss of time, as well as
mental weariness, and wore out his
decreasing strength.</p>

<p>He was, after a time, constantly suffering,
but always cheerful and uncomplaining.
His greatest trial seems to
have been the tendency he saw, especially
in the more recent converts, to relax
the strictness of the Rule in regard to
Poverty; when he heard, during a journey
which would take him past Bologna, that
larger and more comfortable houses had
been built for the Brethren there, he at
once showed his displeasure by passing
by the city without stopping to greet the
Franciscans therein.</p>

<p>He always returned with fresh joy to
the Portioncula, and his life there with
his dear sons; a hard life, supported by
the work of their own hands.</p>

<p>The gentle saint seems to have had
plenty of dignity when called on to
rebuke a wrongful act; we see this in
his dealings with one of his early converts,
Brother Juniper, that delightfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>
simple but most indiscreet of the Minor
Brothers, yet of whom Francis said,
after pondering on his simplicity and
patience in the hour of trial:</p>

<p>"Would to God that I had a whole
forest of such Junipers."</p>

<p>Indeed, on that day Brother Juniper
was in sad disgrace with the other monks.
He was visiting a sick Brother, and,
being afire with the love of God, asked
the sick man with much compassion,
"Can I do thee any service?"</p>

<p>Replied the sick man:</p>

<p>"Much comfort would it give me if
thou couldst get me a pig's trotter."</p>

<p>Straightway cried Brother Juniper:</p>

<p>"Leave that to me; you shall have
one directly."</p>

<p>So he went and took a knife from the
kitchen, and in fervour of spirit ran
through the wood in which certain pigs
were feeding; he threw himself on one
of them, cut off its foot and ran away.
Returning to the house, he washed
and dressed and cooked the foot; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></span>
when, with much diligence, he had prepared
it, he brought the foot right
lovingly to the sick man.</p>

<p>And the sick man ate it up greedily,
to the great comfort and delight of
Brother Juniper, who with glee told his
invalid how he had made assault upon
the pig.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the swineherd, who saw
Brother Juniper cut off the foot, went and
told all the story to his lord, who, when
he was ware of it, came to the house
of the Brothers, crying out that they
were hypocrites and thieves and knaves.</p>

<p>"Why have ye cut off my pig's
foot?" he shouted.</p>

<p>At the noise he made, St. Francis and
the Brothers came out, and with all
humility the saint made excuses, and
promised to make reparation for the
outrage.</p>

<p>But for all that he was no whit appeased,
but with much insult and
threats went away from the Brothers,
full of anger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span></p>

<p>And St. Francis bethought him, and
said within his heart, "Can Brother
Juniper in his indiscreet zeal have done
this thing?"</p>

<p>He called Juniper to him secretly, and
said:</p>

<p>"Didst thou cut off the foot of a pig
in the wood?"</p>

<p>Whereat Brother Juniper, not as if
he had committed a crime, but as if he
had done a deed of charity, answered
cheerfully:</p>

<p>"It is true, dear Father, I cut off
that pig's foot. Touching the reason
why, I went out of charity to visit a
sick Brother." He then narrated the
facts, and added, "I tell thee, Father,
that, considering the comfort given by
the said foot to our Brother, if I had
cut off the feet of a hundred pigs as I
did of one, in very sooth methinks God
would have said, 'Well done.'"</p>

<p>Whereat St. Francis said very severely,
and with righteous zeal:</p>

<p>"Brother Juniper, why hast thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a></span>
caused so great a scandal? Not without
reason doth this man complain of us;
he is perhaps already noising it in the
city. Wherefore I command thee, by
thy obedience, that thou run after him
till thou come up with him, and throw
thyself on the ground, and confess thy
fault, promising to make such satisfaction
that he may have no cause
to complain of us, for of a truth this
has been too grievous an offence."</p>

<p>Brother Juniper marvelled much at
the words, being surprised that anyone
should be angry at so charitable a deed.
He answered:</p>

<p>"Doubt not, Father, that I will
straightway pacify him; why should
he be so disquieted, seeing that this pig
was rather God's than his, and that
great charity hath been done thereby?"</p>

<p>Francis was constantly journeying
about, preaching in all the villages
through which they passed, as well as
in the castles which frowned down on
them, founding new houses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a></span>
Order in and near the larger towns;
he travelled great distances, and carried
everywhere with him the element of joy,
showing it forth in the lovely hymns
which he and his Brothers carolled along
the high-road to lighten the fatigue of
their journeys.</p>

<p>Reading the <i>Fioretti</i>, one feels intimately
acquainted with several of the
Brothers Minor,&mdash;with gentle Fra Leone,
"the little sheep of God"; with Fra
Rufino, styled by Francis "one of the
three most holy souls in the world";
with Fra Masseo, who seems, in one
recorded instance, to have affected incredulity
in regard to the saint's humility.</p>

<p>In those days the Portioncula and
its village were surrounded by a wood,
and St. Francis often said his prayers
therein; one day as he came from them,
he was met at the entrance of the wood
by Fra Masseo of Marignano, a man of
much sanctity, discretion, and grace,
for the which cause St. Francis loved
him much.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a></span></p>

<p>Said Masseo, "Why to thee? Why
to thee? Why to thee?"</p>

<p>Quoth Francis, "What is thy
meaning?"</p>

<p>Brother Masseo answered:</p>

<p>"I say, why doth all the world come
straight to thee? and why do all men
long to see thee, to hear thee, and obey
thee? Thou art not a man comely to
look at, thou hast not much learning,
thou art not noble: whence is it, then,
that to thee the whole world comes?"</p>

<p>Hearing this, St. Francis, all overjoyed
in spirit, lifting up his face to
Heaven, stood for a great while wrapped
in meditation.</p>

<p>Anon returning to himself again, he
knelt him down, and rendered thanks
and praises unto God; and then with
great fervour of spirit he turned him to
Brother Masseo, and said:</p>

<p>"Wilt thou know why to me? Wilt
thou know why to me? Wilt thou
know why to me the whole world doth
run? This cometh unto me from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span>
eyes of the most High God, which
behold in every place the evil and the
good: for those most holy eyes have
seen among sinners none more vile,
none more lacking, no worse sinner than
I.... Therefore hath He chosen me
to confound the nobleness and the
strength and the greatness and the
beauty and wisdom of the world, to
the intent that men may know that all
virtue and all goodness come from Him,
and not from the creature, and that
no man may glory in himself; but
whoso will glory may glory in the Lord."</p>

<p>He often told his Brothers they must
never forsake the Portioncula, which he
and they also so dearly loved. But his
strength was almost spent, and when
he was only forty-two, two years before
his death, he appointed Brother Bernard
vicar-general of the Order, so that he
might give himself up more completely
to meditation and prayer before the
end came.</p>

<p>He had founded a community near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></span>
Rome, and appointed a good and discreet
Guardian thereto; but this Brother
seems to have had some difficulty in
controlling the outbreaks of Brother
Juniper, who had been sent to this
Roman home.</p>

<p>There came a time when all the other
Brethren had to go out.</p>

<p>Quoth the Guardian, "Brother Juniper,
we are all going out; see to it that when
we return you have cooked a little food
for the refreshment of the Brothers."</p>

<p>Replied Brother Juniper, "Right willingly;
leave that to me."</p>

<p>Said Brother Juniper to himself, "It
is a pity that one Brother should always
have to be in the kitchen, instead of
saying prayers with the rest. Of a
surety, now that I am left behind to
cook, I will make ready so much food
that all the Brothers will have enough
for a fortnight, and the cook will have
less to do."</p>

<p>So he went with all diligence into the
country, and begged several large cooking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a></span>
pots; he got also meat, fowls, eggs,
vegetables, and firewood in plenty; then
he put all the eatables in the pots to
cook, to wit, the fowls with their feathers
on, the eggs in their shells, and so with
the rest.</p>

<p>After a while the Brothers came back
to the home, and one of them going to
the kitchen, saw many great pots on an
enormous fire; he sat him down and
looked on with amazement, but said
nothing, watching the care with which
Brother Juniper did his cooking, and
how he hurried from one pot to the
other. Having watched it all with great
delight, the Brother left the kitchen, and,
finding the other Friars, said to them:</p>

<p>"I have to tell you Brother Juniper
is making a marriage feast." But the
Brothers took his word as a jest.</p>

<p>Presently Brother Juniper lifted the
pots from the fire, and rang the dinner
bell. The Brothers sat down to table,
and he came into the refectory with
his dishes, red-faced with his exertions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></span></p>

<p>Quoth he, "Eat well, and then let us
all go and pray: no one need think of
the kitchen for a while; I have cooked
enough food for a fortnight."</p>

<p>And Brother Juniper set his stew
on the table. But there is not a pig in
the whole countryside that would have
partaken of it.</p>

<p>Then Juniper, seeing that the Brothers
did not eat thereof, said:</p>

<p>"These fowls are strengthening for
the brain, and this stew is so good
it will refresh the body." But while
the Brothers were full of wonder at his
simplicity, the Guardian was wroth with
the waste of so much good food, and
reproved him roughly.</p>

<p>Then Brother Juniper threw himself
on the ground and humbly confessed his
fault, saying, "I am the worst of men."</p>

<p>After this he went sorrowfully out of
the refectory. The Guardian, touched
by his humility, asked the Brethren to
be kind to Juniper, who had, with good
intentions, erred through ignorance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span></p>

<p>Such pity had Brother Juniper for the
poor, that when he saw anyone ill-clad
or naked he would at once take off his
tunic, and the cowl of his cloak, and
give it to the beggar.</p>

<p>Wherefore the Guardian commanded
him that he should give to no poor
person his tunic or any part of his habit.</p>

<p>Now it happened that a few days
after, he met a poor man half-naked,
who asked alms for the love of God.</p>

<p>"I have nothing," quoth he, "I
could give thee save my tunic, and my
Superior hath enjoined me not to give
it to anyone, but if thou take it off my
back I will not say thee nay."</p>

<p>He spoke not to the deaf, for straightway
the poor man pulled his tunic off
his back and went away with it.</p>

<p>And when Brother Juniper returned
to the house, and was asked what had
become of his tunic, he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"A poor man took it off my back and
went away with it." His charity had
become incessant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a></span></p>

<p>More than once our gentle saint had
visited La Vernia, a bleak and rugged
mountain some four thousand feet above
the Casentino valley. On these occasions,
his friend the Count Orlando Cattani of
Chiusi, had caused a hut to be built for
him near the hilltop. On this last visit,
Francis felt a pressing need of solitude,
so that he might more entirely give
himself to prayer. He took with him
the three men who are said to have
written the charming sketch of him,
called, in the French version of it,
<i>La Légende des trois Compagnons</i>, Fra
Leone, Fra Masseo, and Fra Angelo.</p>

<p>When they had travelled for two
days, Francis became so weak he could
go no farther, so the Brothers found a
peasant with an ass, and persuaded him
to lend it to their teacher. In doing
this they gave his name, Francis of
Assisi.</p>

<p>The peasant was greatly impressed,
for, throughout Italy and beyond, this
name was a name of power; some way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span>
up the mountain of La Vernia, or, as it is
also called, Alvernia, the peasant leading
the ass said to its rider:</p>

<p>"I hear that you are Francis of Assisi;
well, then, I will give you a bit of advice:
Try to be as good as people say you are,
and then they will not be deceived in
you."</p>

<p>For answer Francis scrambled down
from the ass's back, and, kneeling before
the amazed peasant, he thanked him with
all his heart and soul for his counsel.</p>

<p>There is a plateau at the hilltop
surrounded by pines and huge beech-trees,
but before reaching this the whole
party was so exhausted by the long
climb in the heat of August sunshine,
that they sat down to rest beneath the
spreading branches of an oak-tree. The
birds, accustomed to live in solitude,
came fluttering round them, and settled
especially on the shoulders and head
of St. Francis.</p>

<p>When they reached the top, Francis
bade his companions stay in their customary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></span>
refuge while he went on by
himself. He seems to have stayed
alone, in a shelter contrived by the
Brothers, for forty days, during which
Fra Leone brought every night and
morning some bread and water, which
he left at the door of the refuge. A
falcon used to tap at the door at dawn
to awaken St. Francis. He is said
to have received the vision of the Stigmata
here on Michaelmas Day, and
soon afterwards, leaving two of the
Brothers in charge of the retreat on the
mount, he took a touching leave of them,
and of the place itself. He thanked the
birds who had so lovingly welcomed
his arrival, and especially Brother Falcon,
as he termed it, for his daily summons.</p>

<p>He then took his way, on horseback
this time, with as little delay as possible,
accompanied by his devoted Leo, till
he reached the Portioncula, sorely exhausted
and full of pain. Still he was
bent on starting at once for the south,
and seeking to win fresh souls for Christ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a></span>
His strength rapidly decreased, and his
sight had begun to fail him. He was
advised to make a journey to Rieti,
where Pope Honorius, being driven out
of Rome, was then staying, The Pope
had with him a famous doctor, who
it was hoped might cure St. Francis.
But he had not much faith in earthly
remedies, and declined to go to Rieti;
when, however, St. Clare and some
of the Brethren pressed him to spend
a little time of rest and refreshment at
San Damiano, he was glad to go there.</p>

<p>Though he was in constant suffering,
he seems really to have enjoyed this
visit. Saint Clare had caused a willow
hut to be built for him in her garden,
and though at night rats and mice
tormented him, his joyousness and his
poetic power returned with their early
vigour; for it was during these weeks
of peaceful outer life, though blind,
and suffering from hæmorrhage of the
lungs, that he composed his famous
Canticle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a></span></p>

<p>It happened that one day, while seated
at table in the refectory of San Damiano,
before the meal began, Francis seemed
all at once to be wrapped in a kind
of ecstasy. When he roused from this,
and became fully conscious, he exclaimed,
"May God be praised!"</p>

<p>He had just composed the Canticle
of the Sun.</p>

</div>
<p>He lingered many weeks at San Damiano,
being greatly refreshed by the sweet
peace he found there, and his gentle and
sympathetic talks with his early convert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></span>
St. Clare, who seems to have been as
capable and practical as she was good
and holy. After a while she persuaded
him to journey to Rieti, and take the
advice of the doctors.</p>

<p>At Rieti all those who had previously
known him were greatly shocked by
the change in his health. The doctors
seem to have tormented him by their
efforts to restore his sight, even branding
his forehead with red-hot irons;
Francis bore all with the utmost patience
and sweetness, striving to conform himself
to the pattern set by his Divine
example.</p>

<p>When he at last set forth to return
home, he could go no farther than Assisi;
Bishop Guido had sent him a pressing
invitation to stay in his palace, while
a strong guard was appointed to protect
him on the way, the fame of his sanctity
having made him so precious that it
was feared an attempt might be made
to capture his poor suffering body.</p>

<p>His four most devoted followers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a></span>
nursed him through the weeks that
followed, these were Leo, Angelo, Masseo,
and Rufino.</p>

<p>He remained some months at Assisi,
and amid his worst sufferings poured
out such hymns of joy and thankfulness,
that Fra Elia, who doubtless was already
coveting the power that would so soon
be in his grasp, remonstrated with the
dying saint.</p>

<p>Sick persons, Elia said, were expected
to edify others by their resigned and
saintly demeanour, not by singing so
loud that they could be heard outside
the palace walls. Francis had often
asked his companions to join in his
songs; his own sweet voice had become
feeble.</p>

<p>He had more than ever need of
joy, for with the best intentions one
of his most saintly companions was
troubling his peace by recounting the
changes worked in the simplicity of the
Rule which Francis so dearly cherished:
how larger monasteries were erected for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></span>
the increasing communities, instead of
the small, roughly built houses which
he had always prescribed as suited for
the abodes of begging friars; friars
vowed to possess nothing of their own.
Francis listened, but he had already
seen these changes: he bade the Brother
have faith and trust in God, and never
to forsake the Rule or the Portioncula.</p>

<p>Soon after this he expressed a wish
to return to the little shrine if he had
power to make the journey, adding
quaintly:</p>

<p>"I cannot go so far afoot, my Brothers;
you must be good enough to carry me."</p>

<p>Half-way to the Portioncula he bade
his bearers stop. Raising his hand, he
gave his last blessing to the town of
Assisi, which he could no longer see
because of his blindness.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival he asked Fra
Leo to summon by letter the Lady
Jacoba dei Settesoli, a widow who lived
in Rome, being the mother of two Roman
senators. He knew her devotion to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a></span>
and to the Franciscan Orders, and he
feared she would grieve if he did not
bid her farewell.</p>

<p>Just as the letter was finished, a
trampling of horses was heard outside,
and Madonna Jacoba appeared; she
had felt anxious about her beloved
teacher, and had set forth of her own
accord to see him.</p>

<p>She was only just in time; very soon
afterwards, having dictated his testament
and received the last rites, he
passed away.</p>

<p>All Italy mourned him, but the grief
of the people of Assisi was indescribable.
On the way to his burial place in San
Giorgio the procession stopped outside
San Damiano, so that Clare and her
Sisters might come forth and take a
last farewell of their revered Father.</p>

<p>The death of St. Francis has been
well told by Miss Lina Duff Gordon in
<i>The Story of Assisi</i>.</p>

<p>The more one studies the life of this
gentle saint, who lived and worked for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a></span>
the love and glory of God; the devotion
shown in his ardour to save souls;
the practical help he gave to all; his
complete abnegation of self, and the
happiness which he showed to be
the duty of every one, the more one
wonders at the frequent persecution of
Franciscans. They seem to be best
off at La Vernia. When we at last
drove away from Assisi, along the dusty
roads, which, to those who read the
<i>Fioretti</i>, are full of flower-like memories
of the sweet-natured saint and his
favourite companions, Fra Leone, Fra
Egidio, Fra Masseo, and others, the sun
was setting gloriously; Subasio glowed
like a carbuncle as it reflected the gold
and scarlet splendour opposite, and while
this glow faded slowly into purple, the
long line of the houses of Assisi blushed
like a rose beside the mountain. We
watched till the purple became a rich
grey, painted with pale brown tints,
while the sky just above the ridge of
hills was palest green, changing into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></span>
yellow above. Long lines of purple
barred these delicate tints, and on the
bluer, now cool, sky opposite lay
rounded masses of white cloud with
grey under-edges.</p>

<p>It was dark before we drove up the
steep road into Perugia, and reached
our comfortable quarters in the Hotel
Brufani.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="s08">ADDIO PERUGIA</span></h2>

<p>September had nearly fled, yet
the leaves in the Tronto garden
had hardly begun to change colour;
the air, however, was now extremely
cold as soon as the sun had departed.
The wine-carts which daily thronged
the streets warned us that the vintage
would soon be over.</p>

<p>Day after day, as we looked from
our windows in early morning, we saw
flocks of sheep with their attendant
shepherds, and herds of goats coming
down in great numbers from the mountains.
They trooped past our windows,
and took their way along the dusty
road towards the Maremma.</p>

<p>The poor, tired herdmen looked picturesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a></span>
in ragged thin trousers and patched
coats; they wore high-peaked hats, and
had a sort of make-believe appearance
as they trudged along on foot behind
their beasts. Every now and then came
a padrone mounted on a mule, sometimes
on a horse, with quaint trappings; he
always carried a long pole and a huge
roll of green baize in front of him. We
did not see any women or children, but
we were told that the shepherds take their
families along with them in these spring
and autumn migrations, for they will go
back to the hills as soon as winter is
over. As we watched them we felt
sadly that we too must soon say goodbye
to Perugia.</p>

<p>One of our last walks was to Monte
Luce; and, coming back towards Perugia,
we stopped and watched the sun set;
as it sank behind the purple, bleak hills
the sky above them was blood-red;
higher up, stretched in long broad lines,
was a mass of greenish slate-coloured
clouds. On the right these were reft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a></span>
and showed a sea of golden glory;
while, still higher, clouds of paler grey
sailed over a rosy veil that stretched
itself across a sky of luminous green.
As we went on, the blood-red tint paled
and faded; the clouds above took a
darker hue, and loomed, with storm-laden,
broken edges, over the deep valley
that lay between where we stood and
the projecting bastion, a view crowned
by the weird tower of San Domenico.
This stood up in startling vividness
against the almost appalling gloom that
had so quickly gathered.</p>

<p>Around us the view opened widely,
the triple range of hills showed a sullen
grey of differing tints; on some of
them, where the light was lurid with a
tawny tinge, it was plainly raining;
yet, although thunder seemed imminent
in the humid clouds that hung lower and
lower over the valley, we were told that
probably there would not be a storm
at Perugia. Certainly, we had perfect
atmosphere and perfect weather. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a></span>
hill-city seemed to us in all ways very
healthy&mdash;a place where winter and
spring, summer and autumn, might
alike be spent with charm and profit
by those travellers who love the nature
and art of Italy.

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="s08">LAKE THRASYMENE AND
CORTONA</span></h2>

<div class="figleft"><a name="i_b_299" id="i_b_299"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_299.jpg" width="93" height="154" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OLIVE<br />
BRANCH.</p>
</div>

<p>The most interesting part of the
journey to Cortona is the view
of Lake Thrasymene, with its
reedy shores and islands, near
the picturesque little town of
Passignano.</p>

<p>As one leaves the station below Cortona,
and mounts the hill to the grandly
placed town, Thrasymene comes in sight
again, and adds much to the beauty
of the landscape. It is almost worth
while to go to Cortona for the sake of
the drive up from the station, and the
exquisite view from the city walls,
ponderous marvels of stone-work. But
Cortona is not a desirable place to sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a></span>
in. The inn, when we stayed there, was
not at all comfortable, and although
the town is placed at such a height,
the moss growing outside the houses
tells how damp is the atmosphere.</p>

<p>If Perugia had seemed ancient, Cortona
appeared antediluvian. According to the
old historians, Perugia sent soldiers to
fight against Troy, but Cortona boasts
of having given birth to Dardanus, the
founder of Assisi.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon when we reached
the top of the hill, and when we took
our way from the inn through the hilly,
twisting streets to the Porta Colonia, the
sun had already set, although the sky
still glowed.</p>

<p>Lake Thrasymene looked pale and
weird against the olive landscape.
Before us was a deep valley backed by
a warm, purple mountain ridge; behind
us was the stupendous Etruscan wall.
We followed the course of this down
the steep descent, for Cortona is built
on the side of a rocky hill which yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></span>
towers above it. The blocks of travertine
in the wall are even larger than those
at Perugia. Nestling between them, we
found a wealth of ferns; ceterach and
several delicate aspleniums growing freely
among these grim records of past ages.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_301" id="i_b_301"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_301.jpg" width="479" height="336" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OLIVE-TREES, LAKE THRASYMENE.</p>
</div>

<p>Suddenly, while we were stooping to
look closely at the ferns in the fading
light, there came to us, as if from the
clouds, a full-voiced chant; deep organ
notes swelled above the sweet tones of
treble voices.</p>

<p>We looked up and saw that a convent
is built above the walls. We stood for
some time on this side of the hill listening
to the aerial music. Behind us was the
deep purple of the valley,&mdash;the vast plain
below was changing into a brown olive,
a wild, desolate-looking expanse; but
there was overhead a peculiar clearness
of atmosphere.</p>

<p>The young moon hung high above
the convent towers; its light helped us
to find our way over the rough ground,
till at last we reached one of the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a></span>
gates, and went back through the dark
streets to our inn.</p>

<p>There was not a deserted or sleepy look
about the place. People were gossiping
and trafficking in the streets, and there
were plenty of customers in the shop
we went into.</p>

<p>Our bedroom at the inn looked
alarmingly dismal; large and lofty, it
contained an enormous four-poster with
a heavy, dark green canopy and curtains.
Everything looked and smelt damp; but
when we asked to have the bed aired,
our host said, "Such a thing is impossible
at this time of year."</p>

<p>Next morning we found a busy market
on the hilly Piazza. The town hall
is here, and some women spreading out
orange and scarlet handkerchiefs in the
loggia above gave colour to the scene;
but the people looked somewhat squalid
and dirty after our bright Perugians;
moreover, Cortona folk are indifferent
and sometimes uncourteous to strangers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_305" id="i_b_305"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_305.jpg" width="400" height="355" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PALAZZO COMUNALE, CORTONA.</p>
</div>

<p>We turned into a side street to see a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a></span>
fine palazzo; then, crossing the market-place,
went on to the Palazzo Pretoria.
The walls of this building, both in the
street and those round the inner quadrangle,
are curiously decorated with
small shields bearing the arms of ancient
magistrates; they reminded us of the
Bargello walls in Florence.</p>

<p>We went upstairs, and were told that
the custode of the museum was not in,
but if we waited he would be sure to
come soon. We had, however, to send
more than one messenger in search
of him before he appeared. There are
many Etruscan and some Roman antiquities
in this museum, but its chief
treasure is the famous candelabrum.
This holds sixteen lamps; between each
lamp is a head of Bacchus, while eight
satyrs and eight sirens, placed alternately,
form a marvellously rich border.
Within this circle is represented a fight
with wild animals, then waves and
fish, with a Medusa's head as centre.
The colour of the candelabrum, an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a></span>
exquisite mingling of blue and bronze,
is beautiful. Near it is a painting on
stone&mdash;a female&mdash;said to be very ancient.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_b_308" id="i_b_308"></a>
<img src="images/i_b_308.jpg" width="203" height="201" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BRONZE CANDELABRUM.</p>
</div>

<p>After the museum we went into the
cathedral; the pictures painted by Luca
Signorelli for his native town are here.
Luca was born at Cortona, and was a
pupil of Piero della Francesca. Near
the choir is a beautifully carved marble
tomb, in which the people believe the
Consul Flaminius was buried after the
battle of Thrasymene.</p>

<p>We had not time to visit the baptistery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a></span>
opposite, which also contains pictures by
Luca and by Fra Angelico. We were
anxious to see the view from the church
of Santa Margherita, above the town.
Her statue stands just outside the
cathedral; a little dog crouches at her
feet.</p>

<p>Margherita was not a native of Cortona;
she lived for pleasure only; on
her repentance she entered a Franciscan
convent here, and passed a life of charity
and holy penitence for her sins. Her
conversion is said to have taken place
on the sudden death of one of her lovers.</p>

<p>As he left her house, accompanied
by his little dog, he was assassinated.
The little dog came back to Margherita's
house, and by its cries attracted her
notice; it then pulled at her gown,
till it induced her to follow to where
her lover lay dead. For this reason
Santa Margherita is always represented
with a little dog beside her.</p>

<p>We went along the road past the
platform, where there is a fine view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a></span>
over the Chiana valley, and turned in to
old San Domenico to see the pictures.
The campanile of this church is a picturesque
feature of Cortona. We could
only see two of the pictures, neither
of them very remarkable. Another was
being restored, the custode said. The
walk from this point up to Santa
Margherita was delightful. The sunshine
was brilliant, and the air had a
delicious touch of autumn crispness.
The way beside the wall is steep, but
there are constant views over the country,
and gradually, as we mounted, Lake
Thrasymene revealed itself in pale blue-green
loveliness; a projecting hill, however,
partly blocks the view, and only
allows about half of the lake's grand
expanse to be seen. The yellow turf
was gay with wild flowers, some of them
rare specimens. When we at last reached
the church, we were rewarded for our
climb.</p>

<p>Santa Margherita was designed and
probably built by Niccolo and Giovanni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a></span>
Pisano, but it has been very much
restored; the view from its platform
is magnificent. In front is a screen
of tall cypresses, between which the
purple hills show exquisitely. The
spacious church originally designed by
Niccolo Pisano has been re-modelled,
but there is a beautiful monument to
Santa Margherita by Giovanni Pisano.
Santa Margherita's tomb reminded us
of Pope Benedict's at Perugia. The
saint lies sleeping with her little dog
at her feet; in a bas-relief she yields her
soul to angels, who bear it to Heaven.</p>

<p>The Fortezza behind the church is
said to command a still finer view, but
we were quite satisfied to sit on the
flowery turf enjoying the surpassing
loveliness below us. Hills and valleys,
far-reaching plains, the still lake, and
the sky overhead, seemed to vie with
one another in beauty, yet to blend
into such perfect harmony that the
sensation of gazing was one of complete
repose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a></span></p>

<p>Down a long, long flight of irregular
steps we found our way to the quaint
little church of St. Nicholas. While we
sat gazing we had watched a woman
go down these steps, so we felt sure
they would lead us somewhere; they
took us to the queerest little up-and-down
village imaginable, a village of
mendicants; every one begged of us, the
children being very pertinacious.</p>

<p>One bright-eyed monkey of a boy,
with bare brown legs and feet, and a
red cap stuck over one eye, followed
us down the broken way, dancing and
chattering as he came. All at once he
stopped and pointed to three younger
children, sitting in a mud pool outside a
cottage door, even more ragged and dirty,
but quite as bright-looking as he was.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had a father or a
mother, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Oimè, Signora!&mdash;io son padre di
famiglia," he said, with a merry laugh,
and he pointed again to the black-eyed
urchins.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a></span></p>

<p>We joined in his laugh; his face
and his tiny outstretched hand were
irresistible. He shouted for joy when
we dropped a coin into it; after this,
at the end of every turning we passed,
there was our bright-eyed, dirty little
beggar, with outstretched brown hand
and the sauciest of smiles. When we
shook our heads at him he capered
away, the soles of his slender brown
feet almost as high as his head.</p>

<p>The little church of San Nicola is
hidden away among the houses, with
a quaint little grassed cloister court
in front of it, and a row of ancient
cypresses. On one side is a little cloister
walk; a vine-covered pergola supported
itself by filling up the small space
inclosed. In the church is an altar
picture, painted on both sides, this is
said to be one of the last works of Luca
Signorelli. The fresco, said also to be
his, has been much restored. This little
church belonged to a confraternity, and
the seats still remain along the sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a></span>
of the front court in which the Brethren
have sat in council, or from which they
have enjoyed the view over the wall
that borders this quiet cloister.</p>

<p class="p2">As we drove rapidly downhill to
the station, we looked at the country
through a silver veil, for the olive-trees
are larger here than at Perugia, and they
literally cover the first part of the steep
descent,&mdash;so steep that the road has to
descend by terraces zig-zagged along the
side of the hill.</p>

<p>We had told our red-haired, blue-eyed
driver to take us to the Etruscan
grotto, and he presently stopped at a
rough break, with large stones placed so
as to form irregular steps.</p>

<p>The man was in fear lest the horse
should run away, and was greatly excited.
He went on chattering patois to
that effect; but though I told him I
was quite able to climb up by myself,
he would stand at the top of the steps
hauling me up with one hand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a></span>
flourishing his whip with the other, as
if he were performing a circus feat.</p>

<p>We left him there, and presently
entered a solemn grassed avenue of
gigantic cypresses, their pale grey stems
gleaming in the sunlight. This avenue
slopes upward, and at the end the
ruined grotto shows between the lines
of tall dark trees; it is very curious,
circular in form, with neatly finished
compartments in it for the urns. These
have all been taken away; only part of
the circular top of the sepulchre remains,
lying near the ruined stone; but even in
its fractured state it is very impressive;
alone on the hillside, screened from the
immense prospect before it by a surrounding
of olive-trees. As we drove
down to the railway, far below us, it
seemed to us it had been quite worth
while to stay at Cortona for the sake
of this wonderful drive down the steep
hillside; but the town is probably safer
from damp in August than we found it
in October.
